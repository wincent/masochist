<blockquote><p>Strange, I just cloned the Vim repo and did a clean build of 7.3b. Command-T still works for me fine; didn't even need to recompile it.</p>
<p>Did you have a working Command-T installation before installing 7.3b?</p>
<p>Did you try re-installing the Command-T vimball again and recompiling it? (To be honest, I doubt this will help seeing as I don't think you would even have gotten as far as <code>CommandTAcceptSelection</code> if it wasn't installed and compiled. But it might be worth a try.)</p>
<p>Are there any specific steps that you can post to reproduce the problem? (ie. opening in a split or whatever)</p>

<pre>hg clone <a href="https://vim.googlecode.com/hg/" class="external">https://vim.googlecode.com/hg/</a> vim73</pre>
<p>thanks for your test</p>
<p>Yes I have a working Command-T even after installing 7.3b. But there are some updates on the 7.3b branch later.</p>
<p>Command-t doesn't work well after Jul 21 vim update, the same problem on my home and office pc.</p>
<p>I create a new user, recompiling vim and command-t 0.8b&#xff0c;the same result.</p>
<p>There are no specific steps.</p>
<p>my build configuration:</p>
<pre>./configure --prefix=/usr  --with-features=huge --disable-xsmp --disable-xsmp-interact --disable-selinux --enable-luainterp  --enable-perlinterp  --enable-pythoninterp --enable-rubyinterp  --enable-cscope --enable-netbeans --enable-multibyte  --enable-xim  --disable-hangulinput --enable-gui=gtk2</pre>

<p>no, I use the default vimrc_example ( rename it to .vimrc) and without any plugin.</p>
<p>select a file and try to open it, then it show me those error messages, and the command-t file chooser buffer doesn't disappear.  After I close the file, choose another file from the command-t file chooser ( because it doesn't disappear, I have to do that) Then the command-t buffer was disappear. </p>
<p>I'll try it on my another linux system ( the third one) later</p>

<blockquote><p>Must admit that I find it very puzzling that <code>$curbuf.number</code> is always zero for you. It's definitely not supposed to be that way according to Vim's own Ruby docs, and I haven't ever seen it with any version of Ruby or Vim. The surprising thing is that you've seen it on 2 machines, with different versions of Ruby and Vim... bizarre...</p>

<blockquote><p>Sounds like a bug in Vim to me; it just doesn't make sense for <code>$curbuf.number</code> to always return zero. The bug may be specific to particular distros or platforms, as I don't see it here (on Mac OS X). The bug appears independently of whether Command-T is present or not.</p>
<p>I'd rather see this fixed in upstream Vim rather than implementing this kind of workaround in Command-T itself (what happens if you end up having two buffers with the same <code>name</code>? You'll end up with non-deterministic behavior). Has anyone reported this bug upstream on the Vim list?</p>

<blockquote><p>Hi Wincent Colaiuta, I'm the anonymous an hour ago. My OS is Ubuntu 10.04 and affected Vim version is 7.3 (include 7.3b and 7.3f, that's all 7.3 version I've tried). It seems that in source file <code>if_ruby.c</code>, the global variable <code>curbuf</code> has the member <code>b_fnum</code> with value <code>0</code>, while in <code>if_python.c</code> it has the correct value.</p>

<blockquote><p>To sum things up...</p>
<p>Seems to be platform-dependent rather than specific to any particular version of Ruby, at least from what I can tell here:</p>
<ul>
<li>everyone who has seen the issue is using vim 7.3 (but not everyone using 7.3 has seen the issue)</li>
<li>people using different versions of Ruby have seen the issue (1.8.5, 1.8.7, 1.9 reported so far)</li>
<li>it looks to be a bug in Vim itself, although it is a mystery why it doesn't occur on all platforms (the closest we have to an in-depth analysis of the bug is <a href="/comments/6109">this comment</a>)</li>
</ul>
<p>We have two workarounds that people affected by the problem can use:</p>
<ul>
<li>either use 7.2 until the bug is fixed in upstream; or</li>
<li>hack Command-T to use <code>$curbuf.name</code> rather than <code>$curbuf.number</code>; this an approach that I am quite reluctant to include in any official release of Command-T because the buffer number is documented as being immutable and unique but the name is not (the reason why I am concerned about uniqueness is that Command-T has to get rid of the buffer in question using <code>:bwipeout!</code>, and obviously the consequences of disposing of the wrong buffer are nasty)</li>
</ul>
<p>The issue was reported <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/vim_use/browse_thread/thread/a122376e8dbc6d29" class="external">in this thread</a> but nobody seemed to take notice of it. I don't know if there is some other more official channel that we're supposed to use to report Vim bugs, so I've reposted it to <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/vim_dev" class="external">vim_dev</a> (where it is currently held for moderation).</p>

<pre class="diff-syntax">commit fa3847004abdf5f87333043a3ea5296458e454b7 (HEAD, master)
Author: Wincent Colaiuta &lt;win@wincent.com&gt;
Date:   Thu Nov 4 10:26:47 2010 +0100

    Fall back to buffer name on platforms affected by buffer number bug
    
    I was reluctant to use the buffer name instead of the buffer number, but
    on platforms affected by the bug we have two choices:
    
      - allow the bug to break Command-T, causing support requests and
        requiring people to either patch the source or rebuild Vim
    
      - fall back to the buffer name, which may not be entirely robust but
        at least is better than being totally broken
    
    Seeing as we can maintain the correct, robust behavior on platforms not
    affected by the bug, and only use the fallback behavior when required,
    adding this workaround is probably acceptable until upstream Vim gets
    fixed.

<p>If somebody who is seeing the issue can try this out and confirm that it fixes the problem for them that would be great. (Note you might actually have to use the <code>HEAD</code> version from git://git.wincent.com/command-t.git seeing as this patch builds on top of other recent commits.)</p>
<p>Unfortunately on my system I can't reproduce the original problem even when I compile with <code>--enable-largefile</code>. I don't know if this is because I'm on a 64-bit machine (in which case &quot;large file&quot; is probably the same as &quot;normal file&quot;), or because I'm on Mac OS X. Either way, I can't test it, and it also makes it pretty much impossible for me to investigate the problem in upstream Vim (that, and my ignorance of the Vim codebase).</p>

<blockquote><p>I just checked out the latest master of command-t and tried things out. When I open command-t, select a file and hit enter, the following error shows up:</p>
<pre>Error detected while processing function CommandTAcceptSelection:
line    1:
Zero count: silent b 0</pre>
<p>Then, the command-t file selection window closes (which is a lot better than in the old version I was using, where it just wouldn't close and I ended up killing vim). When using command-t a second time in a vim instance, only one error is shown:</p>
<pre>Zero count: silent b 0</pre>
<p>For now, I just recompiled vim with --disable-largefile. Nevertheless, thank you for your efforts, Wincent!</p>

<blockquote><p>Yeah, the latest Command-T should work around the problem if you are on an affected platform. At the time of writing, the current HEAD in the Git repo is the same as the 1.0b release, so pulling via Git isn't strictly necessary; you could install the 1.0b Vimball if you prefer that.</p>
<p>May I ask how you installed it? However you installed it, can you check that the version you installed actually does contain the fix?</p>
<p>Specifically, the <code>match_window.rb</code> file should have these changes in it:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://git.wincent.com/command-t.git/commitdiff/fa3847004abdf5f87333043a3ea5296458e454b7" class="external">http://git.wincent.com/command-t.git/commitdiff/fa3847004abdf5f87333043a3ea5296458e454b7</a></li>
<li><a href="http://git.wincent.com/command-t.git/commitdiff/aced8ced811d040b26f72f237abe9bd375c4e522" class="external">http://git.wincent.com/command-t.git/commitdiff/aced8ced811d040b26f72f237abe9bd375c4e522</a></li>
</ul>
<p>And <code>controller.rb</code> should have these:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://git.wincent.com/command-t.git/commitdiff/8f38e57f24e3ef86717c6068c5d6212ec1f30480" class="external">http://git.wincent.com/command-t.git/commitdiff/8f38e57f24e3ef86717c6068c5d6212ec1f30480</a></li>
<li><a href="http://git.wincent.com/command-t.git/commitdiff/89dab21b1048c507f9e84ccfaff46bfe4d2c1d9f" class="external">http://git.wincent.com/command-t.git/commitdiff/89dab21b1048c507f9e84ccfaff46bfe4d2c1d9f</a></li>
</ul>
<p>If either of those files doesn't look like they do in the repo, something didn't get installed properly. Here are the links to the entire files as they currently are in 1.0b/HEAD:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://git.wincent.com/command-t.git/blob/66bd7e81adb05fa836993f85970069e6201c71e1:/ruby/command-t/controller.rb" class="external">http://git.wincent.com/command-t.git/blob/66bd7e81adb05fa836993f85970069e6201c71e1:/ruby/command-t/controller.rb</a></li>

</ul>
<p>If those definitely are installed correctly, then I'll need to know more about exactly what the failure is that you're seeing.</p>
<p>And while I'm here, no news yet on an upstream fix in Vim. I did send a report in to <a href="mailto:bugs@vim.org" class="mailto">bugs@vim.org</a>, like I said, but I haven't had any response or seen anything on the vim_dev Google group about it.</p>

<blockquote><p>I was affected by this problem for a long time under vim, but now I can report that ruby (1.9.2-p180) and vim 7.3 with patches 1-125 I now get $curbuf.number reporting something other than zero.  I'm on Arch linux, 32bit.</p>

<blockquote><p>Thanks for the feedback. Yes, I will eventually remove the workaround, but I probably won't be able to do that for a long, long, long time (ie. after Vim 7.4 comes out) because otherwise it will just generate support tickets.</p>
