Git 1.8.1.1 Release Notes
=========================

Fixes since v1.8.1
------------------

 * The attribute mechanism didn't allow limiting attributes to be
   applied to only a single directory itself with &quot;path/&quot; like the
   exclude mechanism does.

 * When attempting to read the XDG-style $HOME/.config/git/config and
   finding that $HOME/.config/git is a file, we gave a wrong error
   message, instead of treating the case as &quot;a custom config file does
   not exist there&quot; and moving on.

 * After failing to create a temporary file using mkstemp(), failing
   pathname was not reported correctly on some platforms.

 * http transport was wrong to ask for the username when the
   authentication is done by certificate identity.

 * The behaviour visible to the end users was confusing, when they
   attempt to kill a process spawned in the editor that was in turn
   launched by Git with SIGINT (or SIGQUIT), as Git would catch that
   signal and die.  We ignore these signals now.

 * A child process that was killed by a signal (e.g. SIGINT) was
   reported in an inconsistent way depending on how the process was
   spawned by us, with or without a shell in between.

 * After &quot;git add -N&quot; and then writing a tree object out of the
   index, the cache-tree data structure got corrupted.

 * &quot;git apply&quot; misbehaved when fixing whitespace breakages by removing
   excess trailing blank lines in some corner cases.

 * A tar archive created by &quot;git archive&quot; recorded a directory in a
   way that made NetBSD's implementation of &quot;tar&quot; sometimes unhappy.

 * When &quot;git clone --separate-git-dir=$over_there&quot; is interrupted, it
   failed to remove the real location of the $GIT_DIR it created.
   This was most visible when interrupting a submodule update.

 * &quot;git fetch --mirror&quot; and fetch that uses other forms of refspec
   with wildcard used to attempt to update a symbolic ref that match
   the wildcard on the receiving end, which made little sense (the
   real ref that is pointed at by the symbolic ref would be updated
   anyway).  Symbolic refs no longer are affected by such a fetch.

 * The &quot;log --graph&quot; codepath fell into infinite loop in some
   corner cases.

 * &quot;git merge&quot; started calling prepare-commit-msg hook like &quot;git
   commit&quot; does some time ago, but forgot to pay attention to the exit
   status of the hook.

 * &quot;git pack-refs&quot; that ran in parallel to another process that
   created new refs had a race that can lose new ones.

 * When a line to be wrapped has a solid run of non space characters
   whose length exactly is the wrap width, &quot;git shortlog -w&quot; failed
   to add a newline after such a line.

 * The way &quot;git svn&quot; asked for password using SSH_ASKPASS and
   GIT_ASKPASS was not in line with the rest of the system.

 * &quot;gitweb&quot;, when sorting by age to show repositories with new
   activities first, used to sort repositories with absolutely
   nothing in it early, which was not very useful.

 * &quot;gitweb&quot;, when sorting by age to show repositories with new
   activities first, used to sort repositories with absolutely
   nothing in it early, which was not very useful.

 * When autoconf is used, any build on a different commit always ran
   &quot;config.status --recheck&quot; even when unnecessary.

 * Some scripted programs written in Python did not get updated when
   PYTHON_PATH changed.

 * We have been carrying a translated and long-unmaintained copy of an
   old version of the tutorial; removed.

 * Portability issues in many self-test scripts have been addressed.


Also contains other minor fixes and documentation updates.

Git 1.8.1.3 Release Notes
=========================

Fixes since v1.8.1.2
--------------------

 * The attribute mechanism didn't allow limiting attributes to be
   applied to only a single directory itself with &quot;path/&quot; like the
   exclude mechanism does.  The fix for this in 1.8.1.2 had
   performance degradations.

 * Command line completion code was inadvertently made incompatible with
   older versions of bash by using a newer array notation.

 * Scripts to test bash completion was inherently flaky as it was
   affected by whatever random things the user may have on $PATH.

 * A fix was added to the build procedure to work around buggy
   versions of ccache broke the auto-generation of dependencies, which
   unfortunately is still relevant because some people use ancient
   distros.

 * We used to stuff &quot;user@&quot; and then append what we read from
   /etc/mailname to come up with a default e-mail ident, but a bug
   lost the &quot;user@&quot; part.

 * &quot;git am&quot; did not parse datestamp correctly from Hg generated patch,
   when it is run in a locale outside C (or en).

 * Attempt to &quot;branch --edit-description&quot; an existing branch, while
   being on a detached HEAD, errored out.

 * &quot;git cherry-pick&quot; did not replay a root commit to an unborn branch.

 * We forgot to close the file descriptor reading from &quot;gpg&quot; output,
   killing &quot;git log --show-signature&quot; on a long history.

 * &quot;git rebase --preserve-merges&quot; lost empty merges in recent versions
   of Git.

 * Rebasing the history of superproject with change in the submodule
   has been broken since v1.7.12.

 * A failure to push due to non-ff while on an unborn branch
   dereferenced a NULL pointer when showing an error message.

Also contains various documentation fixes.

----------------------------------------------------------------

Changes since v1.8.1.2 are as follows:

Brandon Casey (3):

<blockquote><pre>The latest maintenance release Git v1.8.1.4 is now available at the
usual places.

This is primarily to tighten the host verification when imap-send is
talking to your mail server via TLS/SSL.  The topic that was merged to
the tip of 'maint' track consists of 3 patches and is based on the
1.7.6 maintenance track.  This is to make it easier for the distro
folks to merge the topic to their older maintenance branches to issue
hotfix binary releases if they wanted to.

This release itself also contains many small updates to the
user-manual.

Git 1.8.1.4 Release Notes
=========================

Fixes since v1.8.1.3
--------------------

 * &quot;git imap-send&quot; talking over imaps:// did make sure it received a

   certificate matched the host it thought it was talking to.

Also contains various documentation fixes.

      imap-send: move [/tags/ifdef #ifdef] around
