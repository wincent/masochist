Description

<div class='issue-description-body'>
<p>When doing a destructive operation like deleting a record there are two possible workflows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Provide a delete link and then throw up a confirmation dialog with JavaScript to <em>prevent</em> accidental deletions</li>
<li>Provide a delete link with no confirmation dialog, but do offer an &quot;undo&quot; link to <em>correct</em> accidental deletions</li>
</ul>
<p>When deleting spam tickets I am finding that the former workflow isn't as user-friendly and efficient as it could be. If there are 10 spam tickets then you have to do 20 operations (click 10 delete links and dismiss 10 confirmation dialogs).</p>
<p>A much nicer way to work would just be to offer delete-with-the-option-of-undo; then you're looking at just 10 clicks under the same situation. If the volume of spam increases too much then I'll look at implementing mass deletion, but I think that this interface improvement is worth doing anyway.</p>

<p>The argument there is &quot;archive deleted records (somewhere else) rather than marking them as deleted (in-place in the table)&quot;.</p>

<blockquote><p>I was thinking about this earlier today in relation to the &quot;spam&quot; field that I currently have on a lot of models.</p>
<p>It turns out that this has been an unnecessary complication ever since it was implemented. Basically, I <em>never</em> mark stuff as spam; I always just delete it. So all of those queries where I have to add a <code>spam == false</code> condition could have been made simpler.</p>
<p>If you want to do some sort of bayesian training on spain records then you don't really need to keep those records around in their original form anyway. In short: keep the &quot;Spam&quot; button, but get rid of the &quot;spam&quot; attribute in the database tables. Training as spam would analyse the message and update the corpus, and then the spam record would be deleted.</p>
<p>So the point is, if all those queries were made unnecessarily complicated by the <code>spam == false</code> check, then perhaps I should forget about using this &quot;deleted_at&quot; column in the database because it will complicate all those queries in exactly the same way.</p>
<p>It would be better to have a separate table (even tables, one for each kind of record) to hold &quot;deleted&quot; records. Sure, it would be more complicated in some ways (more tables, more classes), but it would make the &quot;99% code path&quot;, the one which gets used almost exclusively, a lot more simple. For basic, non-deleted records (ie. 99% of all use), you can just forget entirely about the notion of &quot;deleted_at&quot;.</p>

<blockquote><p>(Posting anonymously from another computer seeing as I don't have my login details with me.)</p>
<p>I'm thinking that I do want to go ahead with this after all, for the reasons stated in <a href="/issues/1587">ticket #1587</a>. In short, it allows us to elegantly handle the no-JavaScript case, and is a nicer workflow anyway.</p>
<p>The basic idea is to show in the flash, &quot;Record successfully deleted ([link to undo])&quot;.</p>
<p>The undo link would just be a post back to the <code>update</code> action with the <code>deleted_at</code> field set to <code>nil</code>. The update action updates and then redirects to the <code>show</code> action, with a flash saying &quot;Record successfully updated&quot;.</p>
<p>Will need some kind of helper method to produce the &quot;undo&quot; links in a comfortable fashion.</p>
<p>Will still be tricky in terms of adapting the other queries to use <code>WHERE deleted_at IS NULL</code>, but I think it's most likely worth it in the overall scheme of things.</p>

<blockquote><p>(Me again.)</p>
<p>One of the arguments against using this &quot;mark as deleted&quot; model is that the database can fill up with crud.</p>
<p>In reality, it's just a simple mechanism for providing a short-term &quot;undo-ability&quot;.</p>
<p>There is nothing stopping us from allow the admin to <em>really</em> delete (as in destroy, remove from the database) records that are &quot;in the Trash&quot; (marked as deleted). Best place for this is probably in the admin-only interface.</p>

<blockquote><p>In terms of query complexity, the comment model will actually be the most complex because it already has two boolean fields that must be checked on pretty much every query (the <code>public</code> and <code>awaiting_moderation</code> flags).</p>
<p>For the initial implementation, then, will probably start with a more simple model, like the <code>Post</code>, <code>Article</code> or <code>Tweet</code> models, seeing as they at least don't have the <code>awaiting_moderation</code> flag (nor author/user fields either). It will therefore be simpler to modify those queries.</p>
<p>As for the whole object graph question, most (all?) of the &quot;commentable&quot; models use <code>:dependent =&gt; :destroy</code>. So I guess if we mark a parent object like a port or an article as deleted, the simplest thing will be to leave the comments untouched. Any attempt to access an individual one will end up yielding a 404. When we actually proceed to <em>really</em> destroy the parent model (ie. &quot;empty the recycle bin&quot;) <em>then</em> we'll destroy the dependent comments.</p>
