Description

<div class='issue-description-body'>
<p>Although not directly implemented, iTunes has half-star rating capability.   Currently Synergy's floater window will not display ANY rating for half-star songs. It would be great to see this addressed in the next release.</p>
<p>Other features that would be great additions to the program would be: 1. Hotkeys to rate songs as half-stars, or increase/decrease rating by half-stars 2. &quot;Empty&quot; hotkey slots for the user to attach custom scripts to</p>

<blockquote><p>Thanks for submitting the request/report, Aaron.</p>
<p>There are really three separate issues here so I've split this into three different issues.</p>
<p>1. The total non-display of any rating which is not a whole-star multiple (a bug). I hadn't noticed that myself but will check it out right now. I've opened a separate report for this one (<a href="/issues/366">bug #366</a>).</p>
<p>2. The feature request for half-star hot keys. We'll leave this issue that you've opened for that (#365). For the record, Synergy Advance already supports both the setting and display of half-star ratings, and in fact you can make it set stars using an even finer interval if you want (although half-star is the finest resolution that you'll be able to see in the display). The currently released version has the support for setting such ratings and partial support for displaying them (ie. in hot keys bezels); the soon-to-be-released version has enhanced support for display of such ratings (ie. in Growl notifications and elsewhere).</p>
<p>3. The feature request for empty hot key slots. I've opened a separate report for that (feature <a href="/issues/367">request #367</a>)</p>

<blockquote><p>I'll add a &quot;Me too&quot; to this feature request.  iTunes (since 6.0.2 apparently, but I have only been using it since 7) will display the fraction 1/2 instead of a star if there are half ratings.</p>
<p>I'd be happy if Synergy simply displayed half-star ratings, but it would be nice to give Synergy the ability to assign them.  There is already functionality for setting a certain star rating, so the ability to increment that rating up or down (either by a whole star or a half star) would be nice.</p>

<p>Well, Synergy Advance displays half-star ratings fine, but I can't figure out any way to use it to increase/decrease ratings by 1/2 star. The way I use it now (using a hacked version of the quicksilver &quot;increase rating&quot; script) is to set the rating using 1-5 stars (cmd-shift-1 through 5) and then increase/decrease by  1/2 star from there.</p>
<p>(Ditto for this feature request! It's the one thing that's keeping me from switching completely from the Quicksilver implementation (which is just too slow)).</p>

<p>If you're using Synergy Advance 0.4 then you can assign hot keys for &quot;increase&quot; and &quot;decrease rating&quot;, and under the &quot;Advanced&quot; pane in the preferences set the &quot;Rating change step&quot; to 10 instead of the default 20. This allows you to move ratings up and down by half-star intervals via hot keys. For more info see:</p>
<p><a href="http://wincent.com/a/products/synergy-advance/help/preferences/advanced/#rating-step" class="external">http://wincent.com/a/products/synergy-advance/help/preferences/advanced/#rating-step</a></p>
<p>In Synergy Advance 0.5b that setting still works but the preferences UI has been (and still is being) rearranged so you'll have to make the setting using the terminal:</p>
<p>defaults write com.wincent.SynergyAdvance RatingChangeIncrement -int 10</p>
<p>This is only temporary; full access to all the settings via the UI will be restored once the preferences rework is all done.</p>
<p>I'm also looking at other ways of allowing users to set half-star ratings (additional hot keys, and via the menu). See feature <a href="/issues/240">request #240</a>.</p>

<blockquote><p>I'm very, very happy with Synergy, for years already. But I'm also waiting for years to the half-star rating being implemented in Synergy. I know it's been implemented in Synergy Advance but that keeps on being under development... I'm used to rate everything in a scale from 1 to 10, so a song rating of 7, would be a three-and-a-half star. Simply be able to hit ctrl-command-7 would be great!! Would that be difficult to implement in Synergy? It just seems nothing more to me than adding five more Hot Keys in the Synergy control panel... (Already I've attached ctrl-command-0 to a 5-star rating (10), ctrl-command-8 to 4-stars, etc.)</p>

<blockquote><p>Getting and setting half star ratings isn't the hard part. Ratings are stored internal as numbers from 0-100 so it's no hard to use values like 0, 10, 20, 30 etc, than it is to use ones like 0, 20, 40.</p>
<p>The hard part is the UI issue. Adding many more hot keys (or even one more hot key!) will require the hot keys interface to be totally redesigned and that's the blocker for now...</p>
