Description

<div class='issue-description-body'>
<p>I recently re-installed my OS (10.5.7) on a MacPro Intel and have installed Synergy 3.5a7 and now the album cover art no longer shows up in the floater. I have tried unistalling and re-installing but same result.</p>
<p>All of my iTunes files have the album cover art imbedded in them and not stored in a separate folder.</p>

<blockquote><p>It may be a corrupt preferences file or some other such cause. See <a href="http://wincent.com/s/bugs/" class="external">http://wincent.com/s/bugs/</a> for some troubleshooting tips along those lines.</p>
<p>I would also recommend trying with a release from the 3.2 stable series instead and see if you can reproduce the problem there. (For me it works with both 3.2 stable and 3.5 alpha series.)</p>

<blockquote><p>Is 3.2.2 still available anywhere?  I can't seem to find it.  I've (long since, but only now investigating) lost cover art downloads, as well as the handoff of art from iTunes to Synergy.  I've just tried 3.5.5, after being on 3.4 for a very long time.  Little Snitch reports that Synergy is trying to contact Amazon, but nothing ends up in the Album Covers folder.  Seems like I should try 3.2.</p>
<p>Currently on OS X 10.5.8 and iTunes 8.2.1.  I've deleted all prefs and reinstalled, </p>

<blockquote><p>Yes, it's still on the server:</p>

</ul>
<p>But I don't see why 3.2.2 would work and the other versions wouldn't. If Synergy isn't even picking up art from iTunes I would do some troubleshooting (see <a href="/l/bugs">here</a> for some tips on that).</p>

<blockquote><p>(Sorry, I posted anonymously before.)</p>
<p>Yeah, I've tried those troubleshooting tips, and have had no luck, even on separate machines.  Might have an opportunity to try with a completely clean OS install soon, though.  And thanks for the link to 3.2.2  I might try it just to see what happens.</p>
<p>I did look in the console to see what might be logged.  All I get are messages like this (regarding the handoff of art from iTunes), every time it fails: 9/9/09 11:38:38 Synergy[298] Warning: Exception caught while attempting to process cover art data from iTunes </p>
<p>Is there any way to see what (if anything) Synergy is getting back from Amazon? </p>

<blockquote><p>Ok, that's excellent info. That message very clearly indicates that it is choking on something that it is getting handed by iTunes. Have you noticed any pattern about which tracks it happens with? Does it happen with all? Some?</p>

<blockquote><p>Only with some files, all of which have art that displays fine in iTunes (so it's not like there're glitches in the art; or maybe there are, but iTunes itself doesn't mind them).  AAC (not from iTunes Music Store) and MP3 files alike.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, I upgraded to iTunes 9 on this machine without thinking.  And that exception is no longer ocurring, even with the same files that were causing the problem before.  (Using Synergy 3.5.5a or 3.4.1)  My other machine still has iTunes 8.2.1, but is running Snow Leopard.  I move the same songs over to that to see if I can replicate the problem, but I don't know how valid that will be with Snow Leopard in the mix.</p>
<p>Here're some other problems showed up in the console, not immediately after each other:</p>
<p>9/9/09 16:29:20 Synergy[298] Error while cleaning out Synergy &quot;Temporary Album Covers&quot; folder  9/9/09 16:47:45 [0x0-0x99099].org.wincent.Synergy[2029] Synergy: unknown type name &quot;tdta&quot;. </p>

<blockquote><p>Version 4.1 is going to be out soon (within the next day or so) and it includes a complete rewrite of all the cover art stuff. I did find a couple of bugs and fix them, and have done a lot of testing and everything seems to be working perfectly. So I am going to mark this one as closed for now. If there turn out to be any problems in 4.1 we can open a new ticket for that.</p>
