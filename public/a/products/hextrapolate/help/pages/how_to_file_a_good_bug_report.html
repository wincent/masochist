<h1>How to file a good bug report</h1>
</div>
<p>Submitting good bug reports is the best way to get flaws in Hextrapolate fixed as quickly as possible. There are a number of steps you can take to ensure that your bug reports are of high quality:</p>
<div id="task_box">
<h2>Perform basic troubleshooting first</h2>
<p>It’s important to eliminate possible causes outside of the software. You may find that the problem is being caused by something external to the program, such as a corrupt preferences file, and once you correct the external cause the problem goes away.</p>
<p>See “<a href="troubleshooting_tips.html">troubleshooting tips</a>” for information on basic troubleshooting.</p>
<h2>Search before reporting</h2>
<p>Perform a search of the database at <a href="http://bugs.wincent.com/">bugs.wincent.com</a> prior to submitting a report; you can save yourself the effort of filing a report if someone else has already reported the issue.</p>
<h2>Find out how to reproduce the bug</h2>
<p>Reproducibility is <strong>the</strong> most important attribute a bug report can have. This means figuring out how to “reproduce” the problem; that is, working out a list of steps required to trigger or cause the bug. Without these instructions I may not be able to fix the bug.</p>
<h2>Describe your system</h2>
<p>Include basic information about your system such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>the version of Mac <span class="caps">OS X</span> that you are running</li>
<li>the version of Hextrapolate in which you’ve found a bug</li>
<li>whether your machine is Intel or PowerPC-based</li>
</ul>
<p>One way of providing all this information and more is by <a href="obtaining_a_system_profiler_report.html">including a system profiler report</a>.</p>
<h2>Collect information from the Console</h2>
<p>Use the Console application (located in the <tt>Utilities</tt> folder inside the <tt>Applications</tt> folder) to see if anything related to the issue is printed to the <tt>system.log</tt> or <tt>console.log</tt> files. Look for lines which include the word “Hextrapolate”, especially lines which contain error messages or warnings.</p>
<p>Save any relevant lines and include them in your report.</p>
<h2>Collect information from the Activity Monitor</h2>
<p>If Hextrapolate stops responding for long periods of time you can use the Activity monitor (located in the <tt>Utilities</tt> folder inside the <tt>Applications</tt> folder) to gather information about where it might be stuck.</p>
<p>Select Hextrapolate from the list of running processes and choose “Sample Process” from the “View” menu, then include the resulting sample in your report.</p>
<h2>One issue per bug report</h2>
<p>Keep your bug report focussed on a single issue. This will make it easier for others to find your bug report in the database and contribute data to help track down the issue.</p>
