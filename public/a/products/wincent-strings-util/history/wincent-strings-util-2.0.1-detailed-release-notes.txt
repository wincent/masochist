    distro.sh: include submodules in source archive
    
    Not the prettiest of solutions but it basically does the right thing:
    
      1. Use "git archive" to produce the standard tar archive of the
         repository
      2. Use "git ls-tree", combined with "grep", to iterate over all
         submodules at the top level of the repo; at present this just
         means the "buildtools" submodule
         a. Create a temporary directory for each submodule
         b. Use "git archive" and "tar" to get a copy of the submodule
            source in the temporary directory
         c. Add the submodule source to the main tar archive
      6. After iterating over all submodules, use "bzip2" to compress the
         archive.
    
    By design this is not recursive, nor do I anticipate any need for it to
    be so. When/if "git archive" gets built-in submodule support this part
    of the script can be considerably simplified.

    distro.sh: prepare source archive
    
    This is just the basic implementation at this stage: still have to
    incorporate submodules in the archive.

buildtools: Changes from wincent-strings-util-2.0 to wincent-strings-util-2.0.1:

    ReleaseNotes.sh: handle submodules ahead of annotated tags
    
    These changes only affect behaviour when the "--tag-prefix=" switch is
    passed in, which is typically when working within submodules.
    
    Things worked correctly when the submodule HEAD was at an annotated tag,
    but broke down when it was somewhere ahead of one.
    
    Without the "--tag-prefix=" switch we correctly produced results like:
    
      "Changes from 2.0 to 2.0-13-gf96082e"
    
    But with the switch we instead produced results like:
    
      "Changes from 2.0 to 2.0"
    
    And we didn't list any changes at all.
    
    Now we list changes since the last annotated tag in that case, bring the
    behaviour into line for both cases.
    
    Note that this commit does add one "BUG" comment, because I noticed
    while testing that this will break down in repos with no annotated tags
    ("git describe" bails in such repos). There are probably other issues
    too when running the script in repos whose HEAD points to older TAGS (I
    suspect it will always just produce release notes for the latest
    version), so there is still room for some improvement.
