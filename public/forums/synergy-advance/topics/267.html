<blockquote><p>I just downloaded the 0.2 public preview and was confronted with the &quot;you can use Synergy Advance for 7 days then you need to register or stop using it&quot;.</p>
<p>do the pre-1.0 public previews really stop working after 7 days? or is this just in place in anticipation of the 1.0 release? just curious really, because I am sure that I'll end up purchasing synergy advance (as I did synergy classic after less than the 7 day trial period) just want to know if I can wait on making the purchase until there is version 1.0 or does purchasing during the preview phase help get to version 1.0 faster?</p>

<blockquote><p>As at the time of writing the current version of the public preview doesn't actually stop working, but you will continue to see the reminder window if you don't register.</p>
<p>From a technology perspective it's very difficult (well, impossible) to implement time-limited previews which can't be circumvented by determined crackers. So I haven't really considered spending time on developing that kind of technology to be a very good investment of my time at this stage; for now the reminder window is enough. As I get closer to version 1.0 I will tighten things up a little bit.</p>
<p>You can basically wait on making a purchase decision as long as you like; after all, I want my customers to be fully satisfied with my products. I do appreciate your financial support though. It is a great help.</p>
