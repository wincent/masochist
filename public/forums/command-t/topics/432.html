<blockquote><p>Recently, I tried searching for a css file by typing <code>css</code>, and I discovered that the <code>cs</code> mapping provided by vim-surround was putting me in normal mode in the search buffer, instead of typing <code>cs</code>! (the <code>ds</code> and <code>ys</code> mappings are also affected)</p>
<p>I took a look at CommandT::Controller#register_for_key_presses, but I didn't see any obvious reason why the vim-surround mappings weren't being overridden. But, I haven't spent a lot of time digging into the nuances of Vimscript or the vim mappings system, so the reason may actually be obvious.</p>
<p>The issue occurs in both urxvt and Terminal.app, where <code>set term?</code> is screen-256color-bce, rxvt-unicode, and xterm-color.</p>

<blockquote><p>(Edited your post to fix your markup.)</p>
<p>I'm a vim-surround user too and haven't seen what you describe, so it must be something local to your set-up. I just tried to reproduce it and typing &quot;css&quot; at the Command-T prompt just searches for &quot;css&quot;.</p>
<p>Command-T doesn't try to override any existing mappings &mdash; that would be impossible seeing as it can't know what different mappings people have set up and it wouldn't make sense to try &mdash; but it does add its own mappings.</p>
<p>Can you paste your <code>.vimrc</code> up somewhere so that we can look at? It seems likely to me that the cause is somewhere in there. Also, how did you install vim-surround and what version is it?</p>

<blockquote><p>So the problem is my own :(. Sorry to bring it to your door. If you don't mind taking a moment to help though, here is my <code>.vimrc</code>:</p>
<p><a href="http://github.com/guns/nerv-guns/blob/guns/etc/user.vimrc" class="external">http://github.com/guns/nerv-guns/blob/guns/etc/user.vimrc</a></p>
<p>and my <code>~/.vim</code></p>
<p><a href="http://github.com/guns/nerv-guns/tree/guns/etc/user.vim" class="external">http://github.com/guns/nerv-guns/tree/guns/etc/user.vim</a></p>
<p>vim-surround is installed straight from the github repo.</p>
<p>--</p>
<p>It's a lot to wade through, so if you would like to instead just give me a direction to pursue, that would also be much appreciated.</p>

<blockquote><p>Oh! I found it.</p>
<p>I have <code>set notimeout</code>, because I like emacs-style mappings and am annoyed when vim times out my incantations.</p>
<p>Setting <code>set timeout</code> seems to fix the issue, but I would prefer to keep that setting the way it is.</p>
<p>Hmm...</p>

<blockquote><p>Instead of setting <code>notimeout</code>, have you considered setting a high <code>timeoutlen</code>?</p>
<p>I have a hunch that that might fix the problem you're seeing without breaking your Emacs-style mappings (I could be wrong though, it's just a hunch).</p>
<p>If you look in the Command-T source, specifically the <code><a href="http://git.wincent.com/command-t.git/blob/HEAD:/ruby/command-t/match_window.rb" class="external">MatchWindow</a></code>class, you'll see that inside the match window it sets the <code>timeoutlen</code> to <code>0</code> in order to make the keys respond immediately; my suspicion is that by setting <code>notimeout</code> you prevent the <code>timeoutlen</code> for having effect.</p>
<p>If the suggested work around doesn't work for you we can look at other alternatives (Command-T, for example, could be patched to <code>set timeout</code> whenever the match window is displayed, and restore it to its previous value afterwards).</p>

<blockquote><p>Thanks for your help! I decided to just patch in the timeout setting for the match window just like you did for timeoutlen. Works perfectly, and seems like an appropriate addition.</p>
<p>Thanks for your awesome plugin!</p>

<blockquote><p>I run into this problem as well and discovered another bug. If you open the command-T and midstream decide to cancel (CTRL-C, i.e., not to open a file), the settings are never restored. Since the settings are saved and timeoutlen is changed to 0, after I cancel,  my mappings don't work anymore (cuz the timeout len is still 0 and never restored to my original set value). Can you issue a patch for that? Thanks. Rick </p>

<p>Can you explain why or how it is not being restored?</p>
