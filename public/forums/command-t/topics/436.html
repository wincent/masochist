<blockquote><p>Hi,</p>
<p>I've just started playing with command-t and it seems pretty cool. Great job!</p>
<p>I've realized that it may take me a while to retrain my muscles away from :e, though, so I was wondering if any thought has been given to providing a command that can provide the initial string to seed the prompt?</p>
<p>In other words, typing &quot;:e foo&lt;enter&gt;&quot; would have the same effect as &quot;&lt;Leader&gt;tfoo&lt;enter&gt;&quot;. Sort of an &quot;I'm feeling lucky&quot; mode?</p>

<blockquote><p>In a way seems like a good idea, but I am not so sure.</p>
<p>At the moment <code>&lt;Leader&gt;t</code> maps to <code>:CommandT&lt;CR&gt;</code>, which just brings up the prompt.</p>
<p>You can also manually type a command like <code>:CommandT path/to/starting/dir</code> to start the prompt in a specific directory (the default is to start it in Vim's <code>:pwd</code>).</p>
<p>So you're talking here about adding a second parameter, which could be done, or if you want a simpler invocation perhaps even a new command that would operate alongside of <code>:CommandT</code>.</p>
<p>But when I think about this and how it would be used, I am skeptical that it's worth doing. The objective is to overcome a muscle memory problem, but it seems to me that rather than eliminate a bad habit it will just reinforce it.</p>
<p>Remember that the idea of Command-T is to show you the list of results and narrow it down as you type. If you end up seeding the prompt with &quot;foo&quot; before displaying the list, then the live feedback that you would usually see after hitting the &quot;f&quot; is lost, as is the refined feedback after typing the first &quot;o&quot; and the even more refined feedback after the second &quot;o&quot;.</p>
<p>So, while I don't see any major technical obstacles to implementing something like this, I do question whether it's a worthwhile thing to do or not.</p>
