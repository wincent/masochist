<blockquote><p>I woke up this morning to find this email in my inbox, presumably about Synergy:</p>
<p>Quote: when you say freeware mean it! NOT 5$ POP UPS! get this off my mac you ass hole! </p>
<p>That's the entire body of the email, so it may actually be about WinHex. Both programs show a popup, but that's because both programs cost 5</p>

<blockquote><p>A new entry for Email of the Week. A few days ago I got an email from somebody with no message body, only a subject line. It was evidently an unsubscription attempt that was never going to succeed.</p>
<p>I replied, pointing out why it wouldn't work, and also showing that the unsubscription instructions appear in every email I send out (in fact, the person's failed attempt actually contained the instructions, even if the person had never read them).</p>
<p>So this is what I got a couple of hours ago (note that UBB.threads automatically wipes out the expletive):</p>
<p>Code: Yeah! Thanks for the spelling tip s**t for brains!!!!! -------------- Original message -------------- </p>
<p>&gt; Were you trying to unsubscribe?  &gt;  &gt; You've sent me a message with the subject line, &quot;unsubsrcibe&quot; (note the  &gt; spelling). The instructions on how to unsubscribe appear in the  &gt; original message:  &gt;  &gt; El 18/12/2004, a las 23:34, [censored] escribi</p>
