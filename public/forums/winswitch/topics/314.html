<blockquote><p>I just got my development copy of Tiger through the post and decided to be silly and install it on my laptop  (not my main dev box!) which was needing a good clean out anyway. It looks like Apple are going at least part way into WinSwitch's territory, offering 'Short Name' and 'Icon', however so far (for me at least) they don't work yet. I also went and tried WinSwitch and have the following to report.</p>
<p>Installed fine... Removed Apple's switch menu I get the user icon in the menu bar clicking on the menu reveals a blank menu of approx the right size... Menu area goes into the Spinning Wheel of death.</p>
<p>In the console we see... 2004-11-29 21:41:33.066 SystemUIServer[468] *** -[_NSExistingCGSContext window]: selector not recognized [self = 0x4771ed0] 2004-11-29 21:41:33.067 SystemUIServer[468] *** -[_NSExistingCGSContext window]: selector not recognized [self = 0x4771ed0] 2004-11-29 21:41:34.657 SystemUIServer[468] *** -[_NSExistingCGSContext focusView:inWindow:]: selector not recognized [self = 0x4771ed0] 2004-11-29 21:41:34.658 SystemUIServer[468] *** -[_NSExistingCGSContext popTopView]: selector not recognized [self = 0x4771ed0] 2004-11-29 21:41:34.658 SystemUIServer[468] An uncaught exception was raised 2004-11-29 21:41:34.658 SystemUIServer[468] *** -[_NSExistingCGSContext popTopView]: selector not recognized [self = 0x4771ed0] 2004-11-29 21:41:34.659 SystemUIServer[468] *** Uncaught exception: &lt;NSInvalidArgumentException&gt; *** -[_NSExistingCGSContext popTopView]: selector not recognized [self = 0x4771ed0]</p>
<p>Then the UIServer dies (gets killed?) and we see it relaunching.</p>
<p>I know that this is still VERY early in TIger's cycle and don't expect it to be fixed anytime soon, but thought people should know.</p>

<blockquote><p>Thanks for the report. The Tiger developer previews are still under non-disclosure, and I suspect they will be until the official public release. So if you have any further feedback can you send it to me via email rather than posting it here?</p>
<p>For what it's worth, it is my plan to make WinSwitch compatible with Tiger. Just how possible this is will depend on whether Apple gets serious about blocking third-party NSMenuExtras, like they did in 10.1/10.2. Needless to say, I will try.</p>
<p>As you'll see when WinSwitch 3.0 comes out shortly, it has lots of new options, so I expect that many people will prefer it over whatever it is that Apple decides to ship with Tiger.</p>
