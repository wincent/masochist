<blockquote><p>Hello,</p>
<p>While Synergy has a seemingly extensive option set, I am looking for the ability to remap the 'multimedia keys' on my bluetooth Apple Aluminum Keyboard. For example, because I use optical output on my mac mini I wish to have the Volume Up/Down keys control iTunes volume instead of System volume for which the keys currently ignore. Additionally, because I use a non-Apple monitor the Brightness controls are useless on my keyboard, but using them for Itunes Rate Up/Down would be pretty awesome. </p>
<p>Would it be possible to modify these specialty Apple Keyboard keys to do something different?</p>
<p>Regards, cX</p>

<blockquote><p>Those keys are treated as &quot;special&quot; by the operating system and applications never &quot;see&quot; them as normal function keys. As such, there is no way to &quot;map&quot; them in the traditional sense.</p>
<p>However, you probably can achieve what you want by going into the System Preferences, and in the Keyboard pane, there is a checkbox to use the function keys as normal function keys. At that point, they stop behaving like &quot;special&quot; keys and you can map them and do anything you would normally do with any other key.</p>
<p>So, you could then map the F11 and F12 keys to the iTunes volume using Synergy, and you'd also probably want to map your Dashboard and Expos&#x00e9; keys explicitly to F4 and F3 etc.</p>
