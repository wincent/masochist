<blockquote><p>I just upgraded to 1.0a8 and I am having no luck getting the Floater to display information from Internet radio. I've tried multiple radio stations built into iTunes and while track information shows up fine in the iTunes window  the Floater does nothing. I've already posted to the bug database but am hoping I'm just missing a preference or something. Any help out there?</p>

<blockquote><p>Are you sure you upgraded? ie. is there an older copy of Synergy still sitting in /Library/PreferencePanes/ or ~/Library/PreferencePanes?</p>

<blockquote><p>Thanks for your response. I checked and there was an older (1.0a7) prefpane in my main library folder. I must have installed for &quot;all users&quot; last time. So. . . I uninstalled everything using the Synergy installer. Then re-installed. Problem still exists. Basically, the floater will not appear at all unless I turn it off and then back on again. If I do that, it successfully updates with the current radio track as well. However, when the next track begins playing, the iTunes window will update but the floater never appears. I tried disabling fast user switching and it had no effect. I also have tried multiple preference combinations (different floater times and communication times, graphics and no graphics, recent tracks and no recent tracks, etc.) BTW, when I have recent tracks enabled, they show up in the menu only intermittently. I also installed on my iBook and am having the same problem. Both machines running 10.3.3. My guess is something is corrupted. Just don't know what.</p>
