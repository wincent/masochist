<blockquote><p>24 hours ago I downloaded and installed, but I don't get much cover art. Maybe 2 an hour on average. I can see the covers on Amazon, but Synergy does not find them. </p>
<p>Can I add art manually the same way Synergy does? I don't want the art embedded in iTunes in each song. </p>
<p>Where does Synergy get the .plist files it puts in the Album Covers folders? How are they associated with the cover art? </p>
<p>The art is my main reason for wanting the program. </p>
<p>THANKS</p>

<blockquote><p>If you just leave Synergy running it should get pretty much all the art eventually; it puts art requests in a queue and waits between requests so as not to produce too many hits on the Amazon servers.</p>
<p>There is already a thread in this forum about manually adding art:</p>

<p>Personally though, I recommend dragging the art into iTunes, much easier and if its only a JPEG file (a 40KB graphic in a 4MB music file) it only adds 1% to the size of the file, and then you can see the art in your iPod Photo if you've got one...</p>
