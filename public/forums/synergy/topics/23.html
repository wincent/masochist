<blockquote><p>I am currently running the latest stable version of Synergy (I believe its a8).  Since the upgrade, I have not had the musical note in my menu bar why iTunes is closed.  If I open iTunes, I see the buttons, however when iTunes is closed, it seems as if Synergy is closed.  I have not changed any settings, and I have it set to open at login.  Not sure where to go from here.  I did not want to delete the prefs file unless I really have to.</p>
<p>Any thoughts?  I am running 10.3.3, iTunes 4.5 (but had problem before upgrade as well).</p>
<p>Thanks, Brian</p>
