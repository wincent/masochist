<blockquote><p>Hi--</p>
<p>I'm running Synergy 2.8 on an Intel MBP running OS 10.4.6 and iTunes 6.0.4.  My understanding (though I could easily be wrong) is that Synergy should be pulling album covers straight out of iTunes, rather than storing its own separate copies--and yet, I just discovered a folder at Home/Library/Application Support/Synergy/Temporary Album Covers that seems to be collecting a new graphic every time I play a new song (or at least a song from a new album).</p>
<p>Is this correct behavior?  There's also an &quot;Album Covers&quot; folder (no &quot;Temporary&quot;) at the same level, but there's nothing in it....</p>
<p>Curiously,</p>
<p>David</p>

<blockquote><p>The key word is &quot;Temporary&quot;. The covers are pulled from iTunes and temporarily stored there because reading them from disc is much faster than pulling them across from iTunes every single time they are needed. The contents of the folder is deleted when Synergy exits.</p>
<p>The other folder is for downloaded covers, which don't get automatically deleted.</p>

<blockquote><p>Aha!</p>
<p>I guess I've never looked in that folder without Synergy running....</p>
<p>Thanks for clarifying!  </p>
