<blockquote><p>I've been looking all over for a feature and just can't find a good workable solution.</p>
<p>I (and apparently many others from what I've read) have a server mac that houses my music collection and pipes sound (both wirelessly and not) around my home.  I use and love Synergy, but it does me no good while its running on a server in the other room.</p>
<p>Is there any chance of you adding the ability to control another machine via Synergy?  This would be the perfect solution for me - all of the Synergy controls and notifications I love, controlling my music from anywhere in the house.</p>
<p>I've tried the other options, and they all either a) don't work, or b) are clunky and lack the intrusive cleanness of Synergy.</p>
<p>You'd have a ready-made market - no one is doing this job well, lots of folks are using mp3 as their main music source.  It definitely seems a logical extension of Synergy's capabilities.</p>
<p>I'd be more than willing to help test things out!</p>
<p>Thanks, -Tim</p>
