<blockquote><p>So here's the problem:  I have all of this album art that Synergy has downloaded, and they pop up great in Synergy, but when I play those same songs in iTunes (with Synergy off), the album covers don't show up in the little album cover window.  I'm not sure how it all works, but why doesn't synergy automatically attach those album covers to the songs so you can view them in iTunes too?  It just makes sense to me.  At least make it an option!  </p>

<blockquote><p>sorry, I didn't realize that this had already been brought up.  I tried to use the feedback/request form on wincent's webpage, but it pretty much sucks, and it didn't work for me (I'm fairly web savy and couldn't figure it out).</p>

<blockquote><p>Maybe it would have helped if you would call it a &quot;feature request&quot; in the form instead of a &quot;bug&quot;.  Those are two totally different things.</p>

<blockquote><p>Welcome to the wonderful world of Bugzilla... Here it is in the database:</p>
<p><a href="http://wincent.com/a/support/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=8" class="external">http://wincent.com/a/support/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=8</a></p>
<p>And a related request:</p>
<p><a href="http://wincent.com/a/support/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=95" class="external">http://wincent.com/a/support/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=95</a></p>
<p>As for the front page of the bugs and feature requests database, I'll make some more edits to make it clearer that it is for bugs and for feature requests. In most places on the site it already says &quot;Bugs and feature requests&quot; but I will see what other changes I can make to make it clearer.</p>

<blockquote><p>Ok, I've edited the Bugzilla templates so that instead of using the word &quot;bug&quot; it now uses the term &quot;feature request/bug&quot;.</p>
<p>In some places this makes things look a bit repetitive and ugly, but at least there's no scope of ambiguity. An example of a page where this looks excessively wordy is this one:</p>
<p><a href="http://wincent.com/a/support/bugs/page.cgi?id=bug-writing.html" class="external">http://wincent.com/a/support/bugs/page.cgi?id=bug-writing.html</a></p>
<p>In addition if you write something in a comment like &quot;<a href="/issues/12">request #12</a>&quot; or &quot;feature <a href="/issues/12">request #12</a>&quot; it will automatically produce a link to the appropriate issue. Previously the autolinking was only setup to detect comments like &quot;<a href="/issues/12">bug #12</a>&quot;.</p>

<blockquote><p>Thanks for your help!  I eventually figure things out, but &quot;feature request/bug&quot; does make things a lot clearer to a new user.  Synergy is a great program, by the way.  Keep up the good work!</p>
