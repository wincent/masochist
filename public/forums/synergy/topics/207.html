<blockquote><p>I just noticed today that xGestures no longer seems to trigger Synergy's Global Hot Keys.  I'm not too sure when this started happening, but - does anyone else use xGestures with Synergy?</p>
<p>(Current setup: Mouse gesture triggers the &quot;Perform Keystroke&quot; action that 'types' the global hot key ctrl-shift-left.  This is set up in Synergy, and works when I type it on the keyboard... Last time it worked was probably 1-2 months ago?  I don't remember updating xGestures, so I'm pondering the possibility that Synergy changed somewhere...)</p>
<p>Will rollback to Synergy 3.0 (hurrah for keeping old .dmg files around) and report back...</p>
<p>[edit] Nope, doesn't work.  Drat.  I suppose it could have been due to an Apple software update.  That'll be harder to test though.</p>
<p>And the keystroke is getting pressed - oddly, Mail's ActOn plugin reports that 'no action has been configured for [insert random character here]'.</p>
<p>Maybe I did update xGestures...  Time to e-mail that developer and see if he'll send me a older version.  ::sighs::</p>
