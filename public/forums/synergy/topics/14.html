<blockquote><p>I dont know if anyone else has had this problem but ever since version 1.0 betas started coming out synergy has begun to just quit qithout reason.  It will be running and then after a while (usually a long while) ill try and use the skip song feature and it wont work and then ill notice the program had quit and i have to restart it from system preferences.  I am running OS 10.3.2 on a 17&quot; Powerbook G4 1Ghz.  Anyone else have this problem?</p>

<p>Actually, the thread you link to refers to another issue, and yes, that issue was fixed in 1.0a4. I think that the issue we're talking about here on this thread is a separate issue, and it's being tracked here. I have never seen it on my machine, but there are a number of people who have commented on it.</p>
<p>These people say that when they set Synergy to &quot;Display controls only when iTunes is running&quot;, the problem goes away.</p>
<p>So, in the meantime, I ask you to try this workaround (at least then you won't have to keep restarting Synergy), and I will keep looking for a fix...</p>
