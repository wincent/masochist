<blockquote><p>Now that Synergy Preferences is an app, I wonder if there could be some kind of auto-update mechanism for it, as there is with other Mac apps? Failing that, maybe just a notifier to tell you when an update is available?</p>
<p>As it is now I have to check the Blog page for when new versions are released.</p>
<p>Just wondering if this could be a feature request for a future version, if it hasn't already been noted before.</p>
<p>Thanks, Paul</p>

<blockquote><p>There actually is a built-in version check, although it is not yet a full self-update mechanism (ie. it it just a dialog saying a new version is available and you can click the button to be taken to the website).</p>
<p>However, I haven't been sending out notifications since version 4 came out because, being an optional-but-paid upgrade, I didn't want users to feel that I was somehow trying to force them into an upgrade that they didn't ask for. This, and also because I am working on changes to the site to enable full self-update capabilities. My basic idea then, was to hold off on the notifications until the full self-update thing is in place. Your post is a reminder that I need to get that finalized in the near future.</p>

<blockquote><p>I will recommend not to hold back until you earn enough amount of money to buy all you need! You can get the &lt;a href=&quot;<a href="http://bestfinance-blog.com/topics/mortgage-loans" class="external">http://bestfinance-blog.com/topics/mortgage-loans</a>&quot;&gt;mortgage loans&lt;/a&gt; or just student loan and feel fine </p>
