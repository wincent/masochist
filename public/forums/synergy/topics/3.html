<blockquote><p>I'm probably the only dumbass to think that this is *screwy* and maybe if I paid a single ounce of attention to what I was doing I'd not trip myself up with this... but here's my suggestion:</p>
<p>The order that the hot key settings are displayed in the preferences pane are Previous -&gt; Next, which makes perfect sense, but the next two settings are Volume Down -&gt; Volume Up, which trips me up every time I do a clean install and reset my personal HKs because (as I said earlier) I just quickly run down the list and set the keys without thinking too much about what I'm doing.. hell, if I wanted to have to think I'd buy a PC!</p>
<p>Basically, what I'm getting at is that the logical (to me) order would be Volume Up -&gt; Volume Down.</p>
<p>Seriously, this is totally insignificant but I know what a perfectionist you are Win and thought that I'd make suggestion anyway. If others (or yourself) disagree, then feel free to ignore this post altogether!   </p>

<blockquote><p>This is a good idea, which I will keep in mind when I re-implement the entire hot key tab...</p>
<p>I have to change it because people are requesting more hot keys, but there is no room to put them, and the window itself can't grow any larger. So I am going to whip something up like the scrolling view that's used in Xcode (or Project Builder) to define key commands.  </p>
