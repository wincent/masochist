<blockquote><p>The one (and only) thing I dislike about Synergy is that the playlist sub menu is generated only when iTunes is running, and does not go further than one level deep.</p>
<p>The solution to this would be for Synergy to generate the playlist sub menu from the iTunes XML playlist file - which would:</p>
<p>a) Mean the list would always be up to date regardless of whether iTunes is open.</p>
<p>b) Allow songs from playlists to be selected in the menu without a large hit on performance.</p>
<p>I would be most grateful if this could be implemented (I have a license), as this is a great feature present in M-Beat, a rival app (of all things   )</p>

<blockquote><p>I agree this would be a good feature, and parsing plists in Cocoa is easy, so it shouldn't be too hard to implement. The only potential problem is dealing with really big playlists... ie. what do you do when someone has a playlist with a thousand songs in it? Do you just stick them all in one really long menu?</p>

<blockquote><p>Well, M-Beat is able to put my whole Library (by song) in a menu, which is around 1000 songs without any lag.</p>
<p>However, I think there is a limit to how many items can be displayed in a menu.</p>
<p>My opinion is that for really long lists the menu would be smart enough to sub divide them by artist or album depending on the user's prefs.</p>
