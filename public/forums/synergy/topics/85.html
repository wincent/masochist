<blockquote><p>I like the growl support but I've got one (well a few) feature request. Can we get an itemized list of growl events? iTunes update covers quite a lot and I don't really care to be shown if I just paused iTunes, nor do I care to know that a song with the artist &quot;Null&quot; has stopped playing.</p>
<p>Keep up the good work.</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

<blockquote><p>I've got a second very small request regarding Growl! use by Synergy (definitivelly a plus): would it be possible to strip the 'Now Playing:' from the first line and maybe move the duration to another line? I'm using 'Bubbles' as the display in Growl! and the first line is unfortunatelly space-limited.</p>

<blockquote><p>Also, the display format for the artist is: Composer (Artist)</p>
<p>This is really annoying! I know my music by who sings it, not be some bizarre composer Crazy Name 1 / Crazy Name 2 ID field. Can you switch it so the composer is in the brackets, and artist is the main focus?</p>

<p>Thanks for pointing out the mistake. I hadn't noticed it. It is now fixed. You'll see the fix in the 1.8 release (later this month if all goes well).</p>

<blockquote><p>Well, function keys in Synergy don't trigger Growl - I can't 'show floater' and have the growl window show up.</p>
<p>Other non floater notifications such as pause/play, volume and ratings don't use Growl obviously.</p>
<p>Maybe the latter wouldn't be so great right now as Growl isn't quite mature in all of its functionality, but it would be nice to have this in the future.</p>

<p>If you have any more requests or comments, probably best to put them there as they could get lost, overlooked or buried here in the forums.</p>

<blockquote><p>Quote: The new question mark graphic shows in the Synergy floater with 1.8, but not in the Growl display. </p>
<p>This was intentional. Do people think it should be shown? (bearing in mind that it is semi-transparent). Any other alternatives?</p>

<blockquote><p>Surely it was meant to be a better replacement for the Synergy classic icon showing up - it better communicates 'artwork not found' to me.  So yes, I think it should be shown with Growl too.</p>

<blockquote><p>Just to explain my logic, I was thinking that because Growl is a multi-source notification system that it was the right thing to always indicate the source (in this case by showing the app icon).</p>
<p>But I think you're right. Still, we need to come up with a question mark icon that will look good in all the different Growl notification styles.</p>
