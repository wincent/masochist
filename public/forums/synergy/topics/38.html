<blockquote><p>another request; I have some songs that came on my computer because I copied them from my PC. Often these songs don't have a tag, and the name of the song dissapears with the copy to mac. When Synergy encounters those files who only have an artist, and a weird name, he is often able to find from which album it comes. I wonder how he does this, and if this is right, it would be nice if Synergy also would write the whole tag so I also know what song it is!</p>

<p>For now, the only way is to put the correct art in iTunes, then get rid of the incorrect art that Synergy downloaded.</p>
<p>I'm working on a much more elegant system for Synergy Advance.</p>
