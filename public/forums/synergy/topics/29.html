<blockquote><p>I hate to go against what seems to be the mainstream flow here, but as a registered user I ask that you give us an option to disable amazon cover looks, yet still show the cover album art we already have stored. I have a G4 550 powerbook, which should be plenty of computing power for this application, yet when Synergy is running I have noticeable slowdown on my machine while it calls lookupd, etc. Frankly, I don't think Synergy's method of cover art lookup is the most optimized - I use Clutter for my album art downloads and it works a lot better. Basically, I don't want Synergy doing all kinds of crap in the background - I download and paid for it because it was a lightweight iTunes controller and song display. Please give us an option to turn this feature off but still retain album art display in future version!</p>

<blockquote><p>This kind of option should be easy to add.</p>
<p>In the meantime, if you just make sure your art is in iTunes, then Synergy will never look on Amazon for it...</p>

<blockquote><p>Just a note - I'm also on a 550MHz PBG4 but I have no problems with slowdowns when Synergy performs artwork lookups. I don't know what would be causing our two systems to perform differently, but I'm pretty sensitive to performance-taxing programs (one reason I wish Apple would provide another way of getting iTunes status so Synergy wouldn't have to poll) so I don't think I'm not noticing it.</p>

<blockquote><p>Wincent, I have all of my art in iTunes, but sometimes Synergy decides to download it from Amazon anyways. It doesn't slow down my system, but it does mean that when the floater pops up the art usually hasn't been downloaded yet, whereas when it uses the local artwork, it's there instantly. It's a bit annoying, and I second the request for a &quot;Show local artwork only&quot; option.</p>

<blockquote><p>It would be useful if you could reproduce this fault (ie. identify what kind of song it happens on). To do so you would delete the copy of the downloaded art (choose &quot;Show album covers folder&quot; from the Synergy Global Menu) and the next time you run Synergy and play that song, see what it does.</p>
<p>I can assure you that Synergy always asks iTunes for art first, so if iTunes is not giving it for a particular song, we need to work out why.</p>

<blockquote><p>I'd also like this option, though for a different reason. I use FetchArt to make sure iTunes has album art for my  music but some tracks and albums don't have any yet. I'd rather Synergy didn't download art as it will most likely be duplicated at some point or another in iTunes and I'd rather Synergy pull the art from iTunes, if it has it. Turning it off would be a great option.</p>
