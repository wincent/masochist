<blockquote><p>The forums have now been updated to UBB.threads version 7. Please let me know if you see any problems or would like to suggest an improvement.</p>
<p>There a number of new features available. One of the significant changes is that the new version no longer has &quot;Subscriptions&quot; (for receiving email notifications of when posts are made to forums). If you wish to continue receiving notification emails you'll need to log in and click on &quot;My Stuff&quot;, &quot;My Watch Lists&quot; and configure which forums you'd like to watch and how you'd like to be notified.</p>
<p>There's also an RSS feed available (currently broken; the problem has been reported to the UBB.threads team and I am hoping for a quick fix):</p>
