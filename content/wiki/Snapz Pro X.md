[Snapz Pro X](/wiki/Snapz_Pro_X) is a screen capture utility for [Mac OS X](/wiki/Mac_OS_X). I use it to capture screenshots for all of my [products](http://wincent.com/). It can also be used to capture video, but for the purposes of [screencasting](/wiki/screencasting) I prefer [iShowU](/wiki/iShowU).
