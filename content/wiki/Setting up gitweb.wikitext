= Overview =

Once the initial set-up is done, adding new projects to an existing [[Gitweb]] installation is very easy. Notes on the initial set-up appear below. To add an additional project, all that is required is:

<pre>cd path_to_repo
echo "Description of this repository" | sudo -u git tee description
echo "repository.git owner@example.com" | sudo -u git tee -a /pub/git/conf/gitweb-projects</pre>

= Preparation =

== Prerequisites ==

Check that the required [[Perl]] modules are available:

<pre># should run without errors (exit code 0):
perl -mCGI -mEncode -mFcntl -mFile::Find -mFile::Basename -e ""
echo $?</pre>

Note that as of [[Git 1.5.3.1]] a newer version of the Encode module is required than that which ships with [[Red Hat Enterprise Linux]] 3 (see "[[Fixing gitweb breakage on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3]]" for more information).

== Repository set-up ==

Edit <tt>repository.git/description</tt> for each repository that you want to be managed by [[gitweb]].

== Filesystem set-up ==

Assuming your <tt>git</tt> user (the owner of the [[Git]] repositories) has its home directory at <tt>/pub/git/</tt>:

<pre>cd /pub/git
sudo -u git mkdir conf
sudo -u git mkdir logs</pre>

For security we'll run the <tt>gitweb.cgi</tt> script using [[suEXEC]]; in order for it to work we must install the script under the Apache docroot. A symbolic link is created back to the <tt>git</tt> user's home directory as well.

<pre>sudo -u git mkdir path_to_apache_doc_root/git.example.com
sudo ln -s path_to_apache_doc_root/git.example.com public_html</pre>

== Apache set-up ==

A <tt>VirtualHost</tt> block similar to the following needs to be added to the [[Apache]] <tt>httpd.conf</tt>:

<pre><VirtualHost *:80>
  DocumentRoot "/pub/git/public_html"
  ServerName git.example.com
  SuexecUserGroup git git
  
  <Directory "/pub/git/public_html">
    Options Indexes FollowSymlinks ExecCGI
    AllowOverride None
    Order allow,deny
    Allow from all
    DirectoryIndex gitweb.cgi
    RewriteEngine on
    RewriteCond	%{REQUEST_FILENAME}	!-f
    RewriteCond	%{REQUEST_FILENAME}	!-d
    RewriteRule	^.*	/gitweb.cgi/$0 [L,PT]
  </Directory>
  
  # for debugging rewrite rules
  #RewriteLog /pub/git/logs/rewrite_log
  #RewriteLogLevel 9
  
  ErrorLog /pub/git/logs/error_log
  LogLevel warn
  CustomLog /pub/git/logs/access_log "combined"
</VirtualHost></pre>

These were the directives that I arrived at via trial and error. For some reason on my system the <tt>SetEnv</tt> directive did not work (perhaps due to an interaction with [[suEXEC]]?) and neither did the <tt>RewriteRule</tt> in the [[gitweb]] <tt>README</tt> file; this is why I temporarily added in the <tt>RewriteLog</tt> and <tt>RewriteLogLevel</tt> directives in order to troubleshoot (it turns out that the leading slash had to be removed).

== Building gitweb ==

This <tt>make</tt> invocation worked on my local system:

<pre># from top-level of Git source tree
make prefix=/usr/local \
     GITWEB_PROJECTROOT=/pub/git/path_to_public_repos \
     GITWEB_LIST=/pub/git/conf/gitweb-projects \
     GITWEB_STRICT_EXPORT=1 \
     GITWEB_CSS="/gitweb.css" \
     GITWEB_LOGO="/git-logo.png" \
     GITWEB_FAVICON="/git-favicon.png" \
     GITWEB_CONFIG="/pub/git/conf/gitweb.conf" \
     gitweb/gitweb.cgi
sudo -u git cp gitweb/gitweb.{cgi,css} \
               gitweb/git-*.png \
               /pub/git/public_html</pre>

== Configuring gitweb ==

Although some configuration is passed in during the <tt>make</tt> it is still necessary to perform some additional configuration that will be used at runtime.

For each repository that will be visible in [[gitweb]] we add an entry to the <tt>gitweb-projects</tt> list indicating the owner:

<pre>echo "repository.git owner@example.com" | sudo -u git tee -a /pub/git/conf/gitweb-projects</pre>

We also prepare our <tt>gitweb.conf</tt> file:

<pre>sudo -u git tee /pub/git/conf/gitweb.conf <<\EOF
# turn off potentially CPU-intensive features
$feature{'search'}{'default'} = [undef];
$feature{'blame'}{'default'} = [undef];
$feature{'pickaxe'}{'default'} = [undef];
$feature{'grep'}{'default'} = [undef];
$feature{'snapshot'}{'default'} = [undef];

# nicer-looking URLs (requires Apache rewrite rules to be set up)
$feature{'pathinfo'}{'default'} = [1];
$my_uri = "http://git.example.com";
$home_link = "http://git.example.com/";

$site_name = "git.example.com";
EOF</pre>

Note that seeing as this is my first [[gitweb]] installation I want to trial things conservatively at first and so turn off some of the more CPU-intensive features. Also note that in order to turn on the nicer-looking [[URLs]] (the <tt>pathinfo</tt> feature) it is necessary to set up <tt>my_uri</tt> as well. These URLs work because of the <tt>RewriteRule</tt> in the <tt>httpd.conf</tt>. I also found that the <tt>pathinfo</tt> feature required me to explicitly set my <tt>$home_link</tt>, because otherwise the "projects" link didn't point to the true root (ie. it pointed to URLs like http://git.example.com/repo.git instead of http://git.example.com/).

== Troubleshooting ==

=== suEXEC problems ===

One of the problems I encountered when trying to set this up was that in the web browser I was getting an internal server error and this in the <tt>error_log</tt>:

<pre>Premature end of script headers: gitweb.cgi</pre>

But when running from the command line everything was working:

<pre>./gitweb.cgi</pre>

I temporarily set up [[Apache]] <tt>LogLevel</tt> to <tt>debug</tt> but no additional output was produced, so this lead me to check the [[suEXEC]] log (location may vary depending on your system; try <tt>locate suexec.log</tt>):

<pre>[2007-07-15 11:26:28]: uid: (647/git) gid: (650/650) cmd: gitweb.cgi
[2007-07-15 11:26:28]: command not in docroot (/pub/git/cgi-bin/gitweb.cgi)</pre>

This was what lead me to move the public [[HTML]] folder for the <tt>git</tt> user under [[Apache]]'s docroot, and then put a <tt>public_html</tt> symlink in the <tt>git</tt> user's home directory.

=== MIME types ===

I also found that [[Gitweb]] was serving <tt>.sh</tt> files stored in repositories using a MIME type that led browsers to download them rather than displaying them. This was due to the following line in <tt>/etc/mime.types</tt>:

<pre>application/x-sh sh</pre>

This line causes these [[HTTP]] headers to be sent when trying to view an <tt>.sh</tt> file:

<pre>Transfer-Encoding: chunked
Content-Type: application/x-sh</pre>

Compare that to the headers sent trying to view an <tt>.rb</tt> file:

<pre>Transfer-Encoding: chunked
Content-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8</pre>

Commenting out the line in <tt>/etc/mime.types</tt> causes these headers to be sent instead:

<pre>Transfer-Encoding: chunked
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=ISO-8859-1</pre>

And the browser displays the file rather than downloading it.
