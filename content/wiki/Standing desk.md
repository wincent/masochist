title: Standing desk
---

Three positions:

1. Seated: 68cm
2. Standing: 109cm
3. "Parked": 90cm[^parked]

Upper height limit: 110cm[^higher]
Lower height limit: 65cm[^lower]

[^parked]: High enough to shove the chair under the desk, when I'm not using the desk.
[^higher]: Desk could go higher, but cables plugged into the back of the computer aren't long enough.
[^lower]: Desk could go lower, but computer under the desk is in the way.
