You officially can't do this, but unofficially you can, at least good enough for debugging purposes in the development environment, by [[testing memcached with telnet]].

First, connect to the daemon with telnet (eg. `telnet localhost 11211` or similar) and get a slab id:

<pre>stats items
STAT items:7:number 1
STAT items:7:age 22
STAT items:7:evicted 0
STAT items:7:evicted_time 0
STAT items:7:outofmemory 0
STAT items:7:tailrepairs 0
END</pre>

Now, use `cachedump`, passing in the id and a limit specifying the maximum number of keys to dump:

<pre>stats cachedump 7 100
ITEM views/tweets_sidebar [290 b; 1283471297 s]
END</pre>

And you can retrieve using the listed key(s):

<pre>get views/tweets_sidebar
VALUE views/tweets_sidebar 0 290
...
END</pre>
