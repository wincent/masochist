From the [StringTemplate](/wiki/StringTemplate) website:

> StringTemplate is a java template engine (with ports for C\# and [Python](/wiki/Python)) for generating source code, web pages, emails, or any other formatted text output. StringTemplate is particularly good at multi-targeted code generators, multiple site skins, and internationalization/localization. It evolved over years of effort developing jGuru.com. StringTemplate also generates this website and powers the [ANTLR](/wiki/ANTLR) v3 code generator. Its distinguishing characteristic is that it strictly enforces [model](/wiki/model)-[view](/wiki/view) separation unlike other engines.
