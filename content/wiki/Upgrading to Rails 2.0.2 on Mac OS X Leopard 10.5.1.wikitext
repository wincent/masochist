= Cleaning up older versions of installed [[gems]] =

The current version of [[RubyGems]] seems to have a bug in which the <tt>gem cleanup</tt> command doesn't actually remove all of the old versions that it could; it seems to only remove the second-to-latest version, thus requiring you to run it several times:

= Updating an existing [[Rails]] application =

I thought this would be very straightforward as I was just upgrading from 2.0RC2 to 2.0.2, but my first attempt at this failed miserably:

<pre>$ cd path_to_rails_application_root
$ rake rails:freeze:gems
Freezing to the gems for Rails 2.0.2
rake aborted!
uninitialized constant Gem::GemRunner

(See full trace by running task with --trace)</pre>

At this point [[Rails]] had deleted itself from the <tt>vendor</tt> directory (and not for the [http://wincent.com/a/about/wincent/weblog/archives/2007/11/version_control.php first time]), which would obviously be very, very bad news if this were a production system; luckily it is only a development one and I am managing the project with [[Git]] so I was able to restore the destroyed files with a quick:

<pre># note that I have a "co" alias defined for "checkout"
git co vendor/rails</pre>

[[RubyGems]] and [[Rake]] are both already up-to-date on my system:

<pre>$ gem -v
1.0.1
$ rake --version
rake, version 0.8.1</pre>

There are [http://www.google.com/search?q=%22uninitialized+constant+Gem::GemRunner%22+rails plenty of posts] about this kind of problem that can be found with [[Google]]. For example, [http://www.nickpeters.net/2007/12/31/fix-for-uninitialized-constant-gemgemrunner-nameerror/ this post] from 31 December 2007 states that the problem is caused by a missing <tt>require</tt> in <tt>/usr/bin/gem</tt>; inspection reveals however that the needed lines are already present in the installed version:

<pre>require 'rubygems'
require 'rubygems/gem_runner'</pre>

[http://railsforum.com/viewtopic.php?pid=48963 This post] claims that the problem is caused by an additional <tt>gem1.8</tt> symlink that is installed when you do a <tt>gems update --system</tt>, but no such symlink is present in my <tt>/usr/bin/</tt> directory nor anywhere else on my system. [http://blog.ra66i.org/archives/informatics/2007/12/23/a-quick-gem-101-faq-gemrunner-name-error/ This post] explains why it's not present on my system (basically, if your [[Ruby]] is installed as <tt>ruby18</tt> then your <tt>gem</tt> command will be installed as <tt>gem18</tt> too).

Some of the other links I trawled through:

* http://bpdp.wordpress.com/2007/11/28/rubygems-095-and-rails-126-uninitialized-constant-gemgemrunner/
* http://jhernandez.gpltarragona.org/blog/?p=621
* http://www.ruby-forum.com/topic/133792
* http://www.ruby-forum.com/topic/136010
* http://blog.ra66i.org/archives/informatics/2007/12/23/a-quick-gem-101-faq-gemrunner-name-error/
* http://groups.google.com/group/rubyonrails-core/browse_thread/thread/d3e96496eca8735c

One of the suggested techniques was to "unfreeze" [[Rails]] (ie. remove it) from the <tt>vendor</tt> directory to force use of the newly installed 2.0.2 instead. This didn't work out too well:

<pre># or git rm -r vendor/rails if you want Git to track this
$ rm -r vendor/rails

# now try freezing again
$ rake rails:freeze:gems
Missing the Rails 1.99.1 gem. Please `gem install -v=1.99.1 rails`, update your RAILS_GEM_VERSION setting in config/environment.rb for the Rails version you do have installed, or comment out RAILS_GEM_VERSION to use the latest version installed.

# ok, so let's do what it asks us to do
$ sudo gem install -v=1.99.1 rails
Password:
ERROR:  could not find rails locally or in a repository

# let's try our other option:
# comment out the RAILS_GEM_VERSION config/environment.rb and try again
$ rake rails:freeze:gems
Freezing to the gems for Rails 2.0.2
Unpacked gem: 'app/vendor/rails/activesupport-2.0.2'
Unpacked gem: 'app/vendor/rails/activerecord-2.0.2'
Unpacked gem: 'app/vendor/rails/actionpack-2.0.2'
Unpacked gem: 'app/vendor/rails/actionmailer-2.0.2'
Unpacked gem: 'app/vendor/rails/activeresource-2.0.2'
Unpacked gem: 'app/vendor/rails/rails-2.0.2'</pre>

So that seems to have worked. Proceed to update the application files:

<pre>rails .</pre>

Now hand-update <tt>config/environment.rb</tt> to include:

<pre>RAILS_GEM_VERSION = '2.0.2' unless defined? RAILS_GEM_VERSION</pre>

So it all seems to be fine now, but it's certainly left a bad taste in my mouth. This should have been a very basic, routine upgrade. Did I shoot myself in the foot by cleaning up the old [[gems]] before trying to freeze the new version of [[Rails]]? Should that kind of thing ''matter''? How can you deploy this teetering stack in any kind of "enterprise" environment and feel secure about it?
