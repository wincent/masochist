[Mongrel](/wiki/Mongrel) is a web application server for [Ruby](/wiki/Ruby) applications. Although it was very popular in the early days of [Rails](/wiki/Rails) hosting it effectively stagnated and was dropped by the original maintainer; it has since been somewhat eclipsed by alternatives like [Unicorn](/wiki/Unicorn) (itself a derivative of Mongrel) and Passenger.

I personally used Mongrel to host this site from its initial deployment (in March 2008) up until I moved to the [cloud](/wiki/cloud) and switched to [Unicorn](/wiki/Unicorn) (in February 2010).
