A bunch of quick-and-dirty screencasts about [Vim](/wiki/Vim). My intention here is not to create yet another "here is why you should use Vim"/"see the power of modal editing" screencast, but rather a collection of short tips and demos for existing Vim users; basically the kind of content that I myself might want to see.

To prevent this from becoming too onerous, or letting my perfectionism get the better of me, I am giving myself permission for these to be rough, unscripted, unrehearsed and, in general, to suck. They shouldn't be more than a few minutes long each.

# Recording checklist

* Quit all other apps.
* Switch to high-contrast colorscheme (`dark tomorrow`, probably).
* Turn on "Do Not Disturb" mode in notifications center (two-finger swipe from right edge of trackpad).
* Mute sound.
* Close all but one iTerm tab.
* Make sure you hide Screenflow.
* Use [my hacked-up Keycastr fork](https://github.com/wincent/keycastr/tree/wincent), because it works on [Colemak](/wiki/Colemak).
* Place Keycastr at the bottom/center of the screen.
* Leave a gap between the terminal window and the bottom edge (room for Keycastr window).
* For showing web pages, enable guest browsing; note that going "incognito" is not enough.
* Audit recorded video for privacy.
