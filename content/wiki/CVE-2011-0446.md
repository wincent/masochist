There is a vulnerability in mail_to helper in Ruby on Rails when used
    with the :encode => :javascript option. This vulnerability has been
    assigned the CVE identifier CVE-2011-0446.

    Versions Affected:  All.
    Not affected:       Applications which don't use :encode => :javascript
    Fixed Versions:     3.0.4, 2.3.11

    Impact
    ------
    An attacker could specify a malicious name or email value which could
    enable an XSS attack.  All users running an affected release should
    either upgrade or use one of the work arounds immediately.

    Releases
    --------
    The 3.0.4 and 2.3.11 releases are available at the normal locations.

    Workarounds
    -----------
    The simplest work around is to specify :encode => :hex instead,  for
    example:

    Before:
     <%= mail_to user.email, user.name, :encode => :javascript %>

    After:
     <%= mail_to user.email, user.name, :encode => :hex %>

    Those requiring the javascript encoding should escape the javascript
    passed to both values.

    Before:
     <%= mail_to user.email, user.name, :encode => :javascript %>

    After:
     <%= mail_to escape_javascript(user.email),
    escape_javascript(user.name), :encode => :javascript %>

    To aid users who aren't able to upgrade immediately we have provided a
    patch for the supported release series.  It is in git-am format and
