# Efficacy

The following is a [LogWatch](/wiki/LogWatch) sample taken from the [wincent.com](/wiki/wincent.com) mail server during a 24 hour period in mid-July 2006 showing that the migration of two addresses (one business address, one personal address) blocked 142 messages (114 business, 28 personal). One of the domain names has been changed to [example.com](/wiki/example.com) to protect the innocent.
