Notes on peripherals because, believe it or not, my cable management is so obsessive that actually getting around the back of my desk and figuring out what is plugged into what is kind of difficult.

# Display

[BenQ 2700U](https://www.benq.com/en-us/monitor/professional/pd2700u.html):

![benq-pd2700u-ports](/system/images/benq-pd2700u-ports.png)

Not using the "hub" functionality because it is not reliable enough in my experience, but plugging:

- Desktop video coming in via Mini DisplayPort (v1.4), labeled as "MINI D" in the photo. When switching inputs using the on-screen controls, this is the left-most input.
- Laptop video coming in via DisplayPort (v1.4) connector (from dock, see below), labeled as "D-IN" in the photo. When switching inputs using the on-screen controls, this is the second-from-the-left input.

One day, I'd like to upgrade to the 5K model[^pd2730s], the [BenQ PD2730s](https://www.benq.com/en-us/monitor/professional/pd2730s.html), which [will have](https://www.benq.com/en-us/monitor/professional/pd2730s/spec.html):

[^pd2730s]: The upgrade would bring some nice spec bumps: 3840x2160 resolution ‚Üí 5120x2880; 1200:1 contrast ratio ‚Üí 2000:1; increased color gamut (eg. 99% sRGDB / 99% Rec. 709 / 90% DCI-P3 ‚Üí 100% / 100%/ 98%); HDMI 2.0 ‚Üí 2.1; and even the built-in speakers go from 3W ‚Üí 5W.

- HDMI (v2.1)
- DisplayPort (v1.4)
- Thunderbolt 4 ([recommended](https://www.benq.com/en-us/campaign/monitor-for-mac/articles/how-do-i-connect-my-mac-m1-to-benq-monitor-update.html) by BenQ for connecting Macs)

# Dock

[CalDigit TS5 Plus](https://www.caldigit.com/thunderbolt-5-dock-ts5-plus/)

![CalDigit TS5 Plus ports diagram](/system/images/caldigit-ts5plus.png)

On the front:

- USB-A 3.2 Gen2 to Lightning (for charging the ["Magic" Trackpad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_Trackpad)[^magic]): This is a 7.5W port that offers "offline" charging (ie. it provides power even when the "host" device ‚Äî that is, the laptop ‚Äî is not connected)

[^magic]: ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

On the back, from left to right (as viewed from the back):

- Bottom row:
    - DisplayPort 2.1 connector: runs to monitor (into DisplayPort 1.4 socket, as mentioned above); given that the monitor only has DisplayPort 1.4, and the model I'd like to upgrade to _also_ has DisplayPort 1.4, I am using a cable that markets itself only as a "DisplayPort 1.4" cable (not sure if there are any differences with respect to a "2.1-rated" cable).
    - Thunderbolt 5 (host port, 140W): USB-C/Thunderbolt connector running to laptop (USB-C/Thunderbolt port)
    - DC in (24V 13.75A): power in
- Top row:
    - USB-A 3.2 Gen2: USB-A connector running to micro-USB connector on power port of UGREEN switching hub; this provides 1.5A (7.5W) of power. Note that only the left pair of USB-A ports provides offline power, not the right one. In the future (once I have the right cable), I'll instead run power from one of the free Thunderbolt ports, which provide 36W of (offline) power.
    - USB-A 3.2 Gen2: USB-A connector to data port (2) on back of UGREEN switching hub.
    - 10 GbE: Gigabit ethernet, via crossover cable to desktop PC

# USB switching hub

[UGREEN 4-port USB 3.0 switch](https://www.amazon.es/dp/B01N6GD9JO):

- Front (inputs, from left to right, as viewed from the front):
    - USB-A port: empty
    - USB-A port: to keyboard (terminating with a micro-USB connector)
    - USB-A port: Blue Yeti microphone (terminating with a micro-USB connector)
    - USB-A port: Elgato Facecam (terminating with a USB-C connector)
- Rear (from right to left, as viewed from the back):
    - Output 1: USB-A to USB-A cable to desktop PC
    - Output 2: USB-A to USB-A cable to dock (for use with laptop)
    - Micro-USB: additional power in, which should be 5V 2A according to the manufacturer
- Top (status lights, from left to right, as viewed from the front):
    - Output 1 active (desktop PC)
    - Output 2 active (laptop)

Note on the ordering of the outputs/lights: I chose to do it this way so that the light on the left (output "1", the PC) corresponds to the input-selection button to the _left_ on the display; likewise, the light on the right (output "2", the laptop) corresponds to the input-selection button to the _right_ on the display.

# UPS

I have APC Back-UPS Pro BR1600SI (1600VA/960W) UPS with the following ports:

![Back-UPS Pro ports](/system/images/apc-back-ups-pro-br1600si-ports.png)

There are ports on the back that offer surge protection and battery backup (labeled "4" in the diagram), and others that offer only surge protection (labeled "7" in the diagram); I'm only using the former[^overload]; that is, I have cables with IEC C13/C14 connectors leading from the UPS to:

[^overload]: If the laptop, monitor, dock, and desktop are all running and under load, the UPS is probably not qualified to support all of these devices, but I'm not expecting to run the all _under load_ very frequently, if ever, so I'm trusting that this is going to be ok.

- The desktop computer.
- The monitor.
- The dock.

The data connection on the UPS (labeled "1" in the diagram) runs to the desktop computer (because the laptop doesn't care about the power going out in the same way the desktop does).

The UPS itself is plugged in (via port labeled "3" on the diagram) into power strip, in turn plugged into the wall.

Items _not_ plugged into the UPS include:

- Printer (plugged directly into power strip, in turn plugged into the wall).
- El Gato light (plugged into power brick mounted on table leg, in turn plugged into a white extension cable, in turn plugged into power strip, in turn plugged into the wall).

# Appendix: A note on units

The documents provided by the manufacturers use a mixture of different units (volts, amps, and watts[^units]) in various places. In order to convert between different units, consider this relationship:

[^units]: I'm not an electrical engineer, but my understanding of these terms is as follows ‚Äî _volts_: a measure of the difference in electrical potential energy (ie. capacity to do work, move charge around a circuit); _amps_: a measure of the current (charge) flowing through the circuit; _watts_: a measure of the rate of energy transfer. Given that amps and watts both describe transfer rates, it's helpful to realize that amps relate to _charge_ (coulombs) while watts relate to _energy_ (joules). Charge is a property of material that creates electric forces, energy is the more general capacity to do work (more general because it comes in many forms ‚Äî such as kinetic, potential, and so on ‚Äî and can be exchanged between them).

```
Power (Watts) = Voltage (Volts) √ó Current (Amps)
```

So, for example, where above the USB switch says it wants to receive "5V 2A" over its Micro-USB port, that can be considered equivalent to 10W. So, plugging it into one of the 7.5W USB-A ports on the dock is insufficient, but using one of the 36W USB-C (Thunderbolt) ports is more than enough. Likewise, where the dock expects its power supply to deliver "24V 13.75A", that equates to 330W overall.
