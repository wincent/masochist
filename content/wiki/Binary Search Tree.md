# Types

## [Red-Black Tree](/wiki/Red-Black_Tree)

This is a self-balancing [binary search tree](/wiki/binary_search_tree).

The longest path from the root node to a leaf is no more than twice as long as the shortest path. This makes search a guaranteed *O(log n)* operation (insertion and deletion are also *O(log n)*).

# [AVL Tree](/wiki/AVL_Tree)

Another example of a self-balancing [binary search tree](/wiki/binary_search_tree). It offers more rigid guarantees around tree height and therefore faster lookup, at the cost of making insertion and deletion more expensive.
