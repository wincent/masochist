<pre>Changes with nginx 0.6.34                                        27 Nov 2008

   *) Change: now the EAGAIN error returned by connect() is not considered 
      as temporary error.

   *) Change: now the "gzip_vary" directive turned on issues a 
      "Vary: Accept-Encoding" header line for uncompressed responses too.

   *) Feature: the "expires" directive supports daily time.

   *) Feature: the "Expect" request header line support.

   *) Feature: now the "rewrite" directive does a redirect automatically 
      if the "https://" protocol is used.

   *) Bugfix: the "listen" directive parameters such as "backlog", 
      "rcvbuf", etc. were not set, if a default server was not the first 
      one.

   *) Bugfix: the "log_not_found" directive did not work for index files 
      tests.

   *) Bugfix: now if FastCGI server sends a "Location" header line without 
      status line, then nginx uses 302 status code.
      Thanks to Maxim Dounin.

   *) Bugfix: the ngx_http_flv_module did not support several values in a 
      query string.

   *) Bugfix: when a request to a directory was redirected with the slash 
      added, nginx dropped a query string from the original request.</pre>
