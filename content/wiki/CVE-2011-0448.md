There is a vulnerability in the limit() function in Rails 3.0.x. This
    vulnerability has been assigned the CVE identifier CVE-2011-0448.

    Versions Affected:  3.0.0-3.0.3
    Not affected:       Releases before 3.0.0
    Fixed Versions:     3.0.4

    Impact
    ------
    All users running an affected release should either upgrade or use one
    of the work arounds immediately.

    Releases
    --------
    The 3.0.4 release is available at the normal location.

    Workarounds
    -----------

    Users should convert any values provided to the limit() function into
    integers explicitly.  For example code which is currently:

     @posts = Post.limit(params[:per_page]).all

    Should become:

     @posts = Post.limit(params[:per_page].to_i).all

    Patches
    -------
    Given the simplicity of the of workarounds and the low risk of the
    upgrade, we will not be backporting this change to earlier releases.

    Please note that only the  2.3.x and 3.0.x series are supported at
    present.  Users of earlier unsupported releases are advised to upgrade
    as soon as possible.
