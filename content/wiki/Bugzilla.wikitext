[[Bugzilla]] is a very popular [[open source]] bug tracking system written in [[Perl]]. It is both immensely powerful, scalable, customizable, and immensely hard to use for the average non-technical user. For this reason it is particularly popular within hardcore "hacker" communities, but is also the antithesis of "[[Web 2.0]]" design.

I used it for several years for tracking bug reports and feature requests at: http://bugs.wincent.com/

In April 2008 I switched to a custom [[issue tracker]] built on [[Rails]].
