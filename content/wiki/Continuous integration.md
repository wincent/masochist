[Continuous integration](/wiki/Continuous_integration) is a software-development approach based on a frequent build-test (or build-test-release) cycle. See [this article](http://wincent.com/a/about/wincent/weblog/archives/2007/03/planned_changes.php) for a description of my plan to move all [Wincent products](/wiki/Wincent_products) to this model in March 2007.
