vobinfo demuxes a [VOB](/wiki/VOB) file into its component parts but it cannot circumvent the [CSS](/wiki/CSS) encryption scheme. To do that you will need to use a separate tool. Unfortunately, due to the [DMCA](/wiki/DMCA) linking to such a tool would be illegal according to United States law. I'm not in the United States but my server is, so just to be on the safe side I'm not going to provide a link. Links can be easily found with the aid of a search engine.
