I didn't update my local [[Mac OS X]] install because 1.6.1.1 still has failing tests on Mac OS X.

<pre>*** t2300-cd-to-toplevel.sh ***
*   ok 1: at physical root
*   ok 2: at physical subdir
* FAIL 3: at symbolic root

The fix is already in the "next" branch, but hasn't made it into a released version of [[Git]] yet:

<pre>commit dd6c1360b22ee89cb179e2a1fface98ecbeb7b3e
Author: Marcel M. Cary <marcel@oak.homeunix.org>
Date:   Tue Dec 30 07:10:24 2008 -0800

    git-sh-setup: Fix scripts whose PWD is a symlink to a work-dir on OS X
    
    On Mac OS X and possibly BSDs, /bin/pwd reads PWD from the environment if
    available and shows the logical path by default rather than the physical
    one.
    
    Unset PWD before running /bin/pwd in both cd_to_toplevel and its test.
    
    Still use the external /bin/pwd because in my Bash on Linux, the builtin
    pwd prints the same result whether or not PWD is set.
