At the time of writing (March 2008) the *official* documentation for the [story runner](/wiki/story_runner) is non-existent but there is plenty of "unofficial" information out there. The following are some links that I collected while trying to get started with the story runner.

## Top links

-   [Dan North](/wiki/Dan_North)'s *What's in a story?*: <http://dannorth.net/whats-in-a-story>

-   [David Chelimsky](/wiki/David_Chelimsky)'s articles on [RSpec stories](/wiki/RSpec_stories): <http://blog.davidchelimsky.net/articles/tag/stories> (somewhat out-of-date because they were written why the [story runner](/wiki/story_runner) was evolving and not yet released)
-   Relatively up-to-date and explicit example showing how to use the story runner with [Rails](/wiki/Rails): <http://www.tomtenthij.co.uk/2008/1/25/rspec-plain-text-story-runner-on-a-fresh-rails-app>
