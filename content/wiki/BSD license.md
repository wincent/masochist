The [BSD license](/wiki/BSD_license) is one of the big two [open source](/wiki/open_source) [free software licenses](/wiki/free_software_licenses) (the other is the [GPL](/wiki/GPL)). Whereas the GPL is the most well-known and widely-used example of a "non-permissive" free software license, the BSD license is probably the most well-known and widely-used "permissive" free software license.

During the early stages of open source penetration into the corporate world, the more militant nature of the GPL made it well-suited to the task of gaining a foot hold in what was previously the domain of proprietary, closed source software only. The onerous conditions of the GPL made it difficult to abuse without opening oneself to possible legal countermeasures, and the "viral" nature of the license ensured that it gained both publicity and an ever-increasing "market share" in the open source world. The explosive growth of the Linux/GNU family of operating systems was part of a feedback loop in which the success of Linux bolstered the popularity of the GPL, while the GPL helped to ensure the growth of Linux.

After many years, however, the battle for "mind share" has been pretty much won by open source software. That is, we no longer need such a "militant" license to protect our "vulnerable" open source projects; rather, even in the corporate world open source methodologies are often seen as superior and are embraced without the need for compulsion to do so via the requirements of the GPL. As such, I think the time of more permissive licenses like the BSD license has come, and it makes sense for all new open source projects started nowadays to choose the BSD license, or another permissive license like it.

I've released many products under the [BSD license](/wiki/BSD_license), including:

-   [WinSwitch](/wiki/WinSwitch)
-   The [Wikitext](/wiki/Wikitext) RubyGem
-   [Walrus](/wiki/Walrus)
-   [Wincent Icon Utility](/wiki/Wincent_Icon_Utility)
-   and various others
