[[ruby-prof 0.5.2]] was released on 19 July 2007.

= Changes in 0.5.2 =

* This release includes a rails_plugin that makes it easier to profile Rails applications.  The plugin was mistakenly left out of the 0.5.1 release.
* Add rails_plugin into release.

= Changes in 0.5.1 =

I include the 0.5.1 change list here as well because 0.5.2 came hot on the heels of 0.5.1, and I didn't get a chance to install 0.5.1 beforehand:

* Performance
** Significantly reduced the number of thread lookups by caching the last executed thread.
* Fixes
** Properly escape method names in HTML reports
** Fix use of -m and --min-percent command line switches
** Default source file information to ruby_runtime#0 for c calls
** Moved rails_plugin to top level so it is more obvious
** Updated rails_plugin to write reports to the current Rails log directory
** Added additional tests
