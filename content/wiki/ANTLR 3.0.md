[ANTLR 3.0](/wiki/ANTLR_3.0) was released on 17 May 2007.

Finally examples demonstrating the use of the [C language target](/wiki/C_language_target) are available. The examples have also been added to the FishEye repository browser (at <http://fisheye2.cenqua.com/browse/antlr-examples>) but it doesn't look like the set-up is finished as of the time of writing.
