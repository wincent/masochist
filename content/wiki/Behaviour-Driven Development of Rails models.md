Unlike [controllers](/wiki/controllers), [models](/wiki/models) are fairly easy to test independently. In many cases the [model](/wiki/model) is a self-sufficient object and in others the relationships with other classes can be easily simulated using [mock objects](/wiki/mock_objects); this is especially true if the relationships between [model](/wiki/model) classes are kept simple, as they should be in a cleanly designed [Rails](/wiki/Rails) application.
