I've been using [Orion](https://kagi.com/orion/) as my main browser — for personal use only — since about February 2024, largely motivated by its privacy features and my desire to not put too many eggs in the large company (Google, Microsoft, Apple) baskets.

It has a lot of bugs and stability issues, so I occasionally have to switch to [Edge] (which I favor over [Chrome] because it has vertical tabs, and because I can at least avoid putting those particular eggs in _Google's_ basket). At the time of writing, I still use [Chrome] at work (because it is mandated by corporate policy).
