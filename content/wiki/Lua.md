# Lua for JavaScript programmers

[This](http://phrogz.net/lua/LearningLua_FromJS.html) is a great resource for people coming to Lua from [JavaScript](/wiki/JavaScript). Much will be familiar:

-   Functions (including anonymous functions) as first-class values.
-   Closures.
-   Only one real data structure, the "table" (analogous to a JavaScript object), which stands in for arrays too.
-   Single and double quoted strings.

## Gotchas

-   "Arrays" use 1-based indexing.
-   Method dispatch can be done via two operators (`.` for normal dispatch, and `:` which transparently passes the initial "self" parameter when working in Object-oriented style).
-   No regular expressions; just an "pattern" facility that will seem odd to people coming from Perl-compatible regular expressions.
-   [Recursive functions in Lua](/wiki/Recursive_functions_in_Lua) need some care.

## Other differences

-   Tiny language surface area (eg. no ternaries, for example).
