= Overview =

So what do you need to know to handle log rotation for [[nginx]]? The official answer from [[Igor Sysoev]] (the nginx lead developer) can be found [http://www.ruby-forum.com/topic/134115 here]. In short, the sequence you must follow is:

# Move (or otherwise process) the old log file
# Send the [[nginx]] master process a [[USR1]] signal

= [[logrotate]] setup =

There are many ways that this kind of processing can be automated but I use [[logrotate]]. On [[RHEL 5.1]] its configuration files can be found in `/etc/logrotate.d/`. For example, consider the file, `/etc/logrotate.d/httpd`, which handles the rotation of [[Apache]] log files:

<pre>/var/log/httpd/*log {
    missingok
    notifempty
    sharedscripts
    postrotate
        /bin/kill -HUP `cat /var/run/httpd.pid 2>/dev/null` 2> /dev/null || true
    endscript
}

/home/*/log/*log {
    missingok
    notifempty
    sharedscripts
    postrotate
        /bin/kill -HUP `cat /var/run/httpd.pid 2>/dev/null` 2> /dev/null || true
    endscript
}</pre>

Using this as a model, and consulting the `logrotate` [[man page]], we come up with a file like this for [[nginx]], `/etc/logrotate.d/nginx`. Obviously the paths on your local system will most likely vary. Here I specify log rotation for two separate [[Rails]] applications, each of which has its own nginx master process (note the different [[PID]] files).

<pre>/home/path_to_rails_app_1/deploy/shared/log/*_log {
    missingok
    notifempty
    sharedscripts
    postrotate
        test ! -f /var/run/nginx.pid || kill -USR1 `cat /var/run/nginx.pid`
    endscript  
}

/home/path_to_rails_app_2/deploy/shared/log/*_log {
    missingok
    notifempty
    sharedscripts
    postrotate
        test ! -f /var/run/nginx-staging.pid || kill -USR1 `cat /var/run/nginx-staging.pid`
    endscript  
}</pre>

I'm actually quite glad that I looked into this because in doing so I noticed that having [[nginx]] write its log files to the same location as [[Apache]] wouldn't be a good thing (this is the way I initially had it set up). As you can see, these log files would be rotated according to the rules in the `/etc/logrotate.d/httpd` file and nginx would never receive the required[[USR1]] signal.

== Testing ==

<pre># -d turns on debug mode: output is verbose, no actual changes are made to the log files
sudo logrotate -d /etc/logrotate.conf /etc/logrotate.d/nginx

# if the debug output looks good, proceed with a real rotation (-v turns on verbose output)
sudo logrotate -v /etc/logrotate.conf /etc/logrotate.d/nginx</pre>

In my initial testing this log rotation did ''not'' work as expected; the verbose output ended with lines like the following:

<pre>renaming /home/path_to_app/deploy/shared/log/access_log to /home/path_to_app/deploy/shared/log/access_log.1
disposeName will be /home/path_to_app/deploy/shared/log/access_log.1
running postrotate script
removing old log /home/path_to_app/deploy/shared/log/access_log.1</pre> 

In other words:

# Rename `access_log` to `access_log.1` (correct)
# Run the `postrotate` script (correct)
# Remove oldest log file, `access_log.1` (incorrect!)

That last action is the unexpected one, because in my `/etc/logrotate.conf` file (where global settings are stored) I have:

<pre># keep 4 weeks worth of backlogs
rotate 4</pre> 

Troubleshooting permutations attempted:

* Remove `nocreate` line from `/etc/logrotate.d/nginx` (no visible effect)
* Add explicit `rotate 4` to `/etc/logrotate.d/nginx` (works)

For each permutation is is necessary to hit the website (to make sure the log is non-empty) and also pass the `-f` (force) flag to `logrotate`, otherwise it will most likely refuse to rotate the log file because of its size. I finally realized that my initial runs did not behave as expected because I wasn't passing in `/etc/logwatch.conf` as the first parameter (it is not pulled in automatically); in other words, to test out a custom file in `/etc/logwatch.d` as it would really be executed in normal use you must precede it with `/etc/logwatch.conf` on the command line. Once I realized this I removed the explicit `rotate 4` from the `/etc/logwatch.d/nginx` configuration file.

= Rotating other [[Rails]] log files =

The [[nginx]] log files are only part of the situation. When you run [[mongrel_cluster]] you'll get another log file `mongrel.12345.log` (where `12345` is the port number the [[mongrel]] instance is listening on) for each mongrel instance in the cluster, as well as the traditional `production.log`, `development.log`, `test.log` and any others that your application might produce.
