# Open a new tab to the right of the current tab

Normally, hitting `‚åò-T` will open a new tab at the _end_ of the list of tabs. I often want to open the tab right next to the one I'm working in (ie. if I'm working inside a tab group).

As an alternative to installing [a browser extension](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/new-adjacent-tab/fommpldicogfgegfpcoibmhkbbdpodjg), you can do this by defining a custom search, based on [this 2011 tip](https://ladyalys.blogspot.com/2011/08/chrome-tip-open-new-tab-next-to-current.html):

1. Go to `chrome://settings/searchEngines`
2. Under "Site search", click "Add".
3. Enter "Name": "New tab", "Shortcut": "tt" (mnemonic: "tab"), and "URL": `javascript:window.open();`

To create a new tab to the right of the current tab, hit `‚åò-L`, type `tt`, then `Enter`.

Additionally, if you want a way of creating a new tab to the right with a click (as opposed to right-clicking on a tab and selecting "New Tab to the Right"), you can create a bookmark and stick it in your bookmark bar with a name like "üìÅ" and the same URL as above (`javascript:window.open();`).

# Duplicate the current tab to the right

Again, you can do this by right-clicking and choosing "Duplicate", but if you want to do this from the keyboard, you can use the search engine trick, this time with `javascript:(function(){window.open(window.location.href, '_blank');})();` to copy the current `window.location` into the new tab. Assign it a shortcut like "dt" (mnemonic: "duplicate tab"), and you'll be able to create a duplicate tab by hitting `‚åò-L`, typing `dt`, and hitting `Enter`.
