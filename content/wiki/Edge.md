Around 2021, I switched from [Chrome](/wiki/Chrome) to Microsoft's [Edge](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/edge) because:

- It has proper vertical tabs.
- I wanted to avoid putting too many eggs in the "Google" basket (see: [De-googling](/wiki/De-googling)).

It has a lot of steaming-hot-garbage AI features, but they can mostly be turned off.

I still use [Chrome](/wiki/Chrome) at work, because it is mandated by corporate policy. For personal use, I prefer [Orion](/wiki/Orion).
