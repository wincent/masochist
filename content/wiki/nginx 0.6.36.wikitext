<pre>Changes with nginx 0.6.36                                        02 Apr 2009

   *) Change: now the "Invalid argument" error returned by 
      setsockopt(TCP_NODELAY) on Solaris, is ignored.

   *) Change: now POSTs without "Content-Length" header line are allowed.

   *) Feature: the "try_files" directive.

   *) Feature: the --with-pcre option in the configure.

   *) Feature: the "if_modified_since" directive.

   *) Feature: the "$cookie_..." variables.

   *) Feature: the "$arg_..." variables.

   *) Bugfix: compatibility with Tru64 UNIX.
      Thanks to Dustin Marquess.

   *) Bugfix: a "ssl_engine" directive did not use a SSL-accelerator for 
      asymmetric ciphers.
      Thanks to Marcin Gozdalik.

   *) Bugfix: in a redirect rewrite directive original arguments were 
      concatenated with new arguments by a "?" rather than an "&";
      the bug had appeared in 0.1.18.
      Thanks to Maxim Dounin.

   *) Bugfix: nginx could not be built on AIX.

   *) Bugfix: a double response might be returned if the epoll or rtsig 
      methods are used and a redirect was returned to a request with 
      body.
      Thanks to Eden Li.

   *) Bugfix: a segmentation fault might occur in worker process if 
      "resolver" directive was used in SMTP proxy.

   *) Bugfix: fastcgi_store stored files not always.

   *) Bugfix: nginx did not process a FastCGI server response, if the 
      server send too many messages to stderr before response.</pre>

= Updating =

I am not sure whether I will bother with this update, seeing as none of the features really interest mere, nor do any of the bug fixes look relevant to my usage.
