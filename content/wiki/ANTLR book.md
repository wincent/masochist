There is some documentation on the official site but the best documentation by far is *The Definitive ANTLR Reference* by [Terence Parr](/wiki/Terence_Parr), the author of [ANTLR](/wiki/ANTLR):

-   <http://www.pragmaticprogrammer.com/titles/tpantlr/index.html>

[ANTLR](/wiki/ANTLR) itself is free software released under the [BSD license](/wiki/BSD_license) so purchasing the book is a great way to support Terence's efforts. I purchased the "beta" version of the book in [PDF](/wiki/PDF) ($25), which includes access to the final version of the book when it is published (in May 2007). The quality of the [Pragmatic](/wiki/Pragmatic) [PDFs](/wiki/PDFs) is very high.

You can also support by posting a review of the book at [Amazon](/wiki/Amazon), as your review may encourage others to make a purchase:
