[BBEdit](/wiki/BBEdit) is a text editor for [Mac OS X](/wiki/Mac_OS_X) popular among developers and web designers. It's principal competition comes from [TextMate](/wiki/TextMate).

Personally, I think each tool has its strengths (BBEdit is better engineered for large projects with many files, TextMate looks and feels nicer) and weaknesses (BBEdit is a little ugly, and TextMate turns into an unsustainable resource hog when you throw a lot of files at it).

I purchased licenses for both back in the day, although I haven't used either of them for several years now.

Historically, I tended to do raw [HTML](/wiki/HTML) or [PHP](/wiki/PHP) work in [BBEdit](/wiki/BBEdit), [Ruby](/wiki/Ruby) in [TextMate](/wiki/TextMate), and [Xcode](/wiki/Xcode) was my editing environment of choice for [Objective-C](/wiki/Objective-C) projects.

Now, I tend to do basically everything in [MacVim](/wiki/MacVim), and although I use [Xcode](/wiki/Xcode) for project organization, making build settings and debugging, I actually have MacVim set up as an external editor so that I can use it on demand whenever I need.
