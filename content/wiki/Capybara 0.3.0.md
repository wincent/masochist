From the official release announcement:

    Announcing the first "beta" release of Capybara. 

    Not only are there numerous improvements in edge cases for forms, 
    links, fields and all that, but there are some awesome new features 
    too: 

    * Capybara now automatically waits for asynchronous JavaScript to 
    finish doing it's thing. This feature essentially means that you'll 
    hardly ever need to worry about asynchronous processes messing up your 
    tests. See the section in the README for more details. 
    * Improved webrat compatibility, including the much requested 
    current_url method, and ability to select fields by name. 
    * celerity driver for JRuby fans 
    * response headers for drivers that support it (not on selenium yet, 
    sorry) 
    * Ruby 1.9 compatibility (kinda) 
    * Capybara.app_host make it possible to run against a remote server 

    And much more! 

    A huge thank you to the many contributors! Without you, this wouldn't 
    have been possible!
