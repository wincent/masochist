# Pushing matching refs

    git push origin :

# Retrieving a file from a specific revision

    git show <treeish>:filename

For example, if you delete a file in a particular revision, say 3ad8389, and only later discover that you should have kept it, you can get it back with:

    git show 3ad8389~1:filename > filename

(ie. show the file as it was in the revision before 3ad8389, where it got deleted.)

Equivalent in this case is:

    git checkout 3ad8389~1 -- filename

This just writes the file back out to the working tree without touching the HEAD.

# Negative pathspecs

`:!` (or `:^`, or `:(exclude)`) ([source](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5685007/making-git-log-ignore-changes-for-certain-paths)).

Example; examining a diff that contains a bunch of copies and renames as well as abundant changes to "package-lock.json" files:

```bash
git diff develop -C10 -M20 -b --find-copies-harder -- ':!*-lock.json'`
```

Example: getting a diffstat for a commit excluding changes to unit test files:

```bash
git show --stat -- ':(exclude)*unit*'
```
