[[Behaviour-Driven Development]] or [[BDD]] is a reformulation of [[Test-Driven Development]] expressed in terms of desired behaviours. It is not fundamentally different from existing [[TDD]] best practices, but the vocabulary employed is intended to gently guide people towards those best practices by making it easy to think about things the "right way".

An example of a [[BDD]] framework is [[RSpec]]. I've used it in the development of pretty much every [[Ruby]] project I've ever written (see [[Walrus]] and [[Wikitext]] for examples; the [[Rails]] application that powers this site, which isn't yet [[open source]], also heavily uses RSpec).
