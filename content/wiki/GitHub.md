Not to be confused with [Git](/wiki/Git) (currently the most popular [distributed version control system](/wiki/distributed_version_control_system)) itself, [GitHub](https://github.com) is a private company that provides Git repository hosting as well as a slew of other features. I worked there from 2021 to 2024; ask me about it some time and I'll tell you some war stories...

Alternatives to GitHub include (or included):

-   [Codeberg](https://codeberg.org).
-   [sourcehut](https://git.sr.ht).
-   [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/).
-   [BitBucket](https://bitbucket.org/).
-   [Gitorious](/wiki/Gitorious) (now defunct).
-   Git itself, which includes tools for hosting your own repositories using your own infrastructure.
-   Many others...
