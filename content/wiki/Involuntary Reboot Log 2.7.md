The dreaded "Saf BB FQ KP"\* strikes again.

[Safari](/wiki/Safari) locks up after reloading a page with an embedded video on it that stopped mid-playback. I open Activity Monitor and sample the non-responsive process to confirm my suspicion that it is, as always, a plug-in which is responsible.

Confirmed the suspicion, I proceed to [force quit](/wiki/force_quit) the [beach balling](/wiki/beach_balling) process, and to my surprise, the machine immediately [kernel panics](/wiki/kernel_panics).

The average time between failures drops again with the incident, and this machine looks set to be by far the least reliable I have ever owned. On the bright side, at least there haven't been any failed hardware components yet, unlike my last iMac which was absolutely plagued by them, but I guess it is only a matter of time.
