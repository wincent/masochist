Here follow some notes from The World's Worst C Programmer.

I've written lots of C or C-like (eg. [Objective-C]) code over the years, but I do it rarely enough nowadays (ie. writing this in 2022) that whenever I come back to it there are a bunch of things I have forgotten and have to look up again. So, here is a scratchpad for me to jot some notes down in the hope that I won't forget, again, what all these details are.

# Debugging segmentation faults

## With `clang`/`lldb` on [macOS]

1. Build with `-g` (debug symbols) and `-O0` (optimizations off).
2. Launch with `lldb --file $executable`.
3. Run with `r`.
4. See backtrace with `bt`.

## With `gdb` on [Arch Linux]

You can also launch executables with `gdb` (ie. after `yay -S gdb`).

1. Launch with `gdb executable`.
2. Run with `r` (or `r [arguments]`).
3. See backtrace with `bt`.

You have the additional option of inspecting a core dump after the fact; example:

```
# unzstd /var/lib/systemd/coredump/core.nvim.1000.008a013d9f0d4e769d9dbcfdd9d9584a.13538.1656944479000000.std
# chmod 666 /var/lib/systemd/coredump/core.nvim.1000.008a013d9f0d4e769d9dbcfdd9d9584a.13538.1656944479000000
$ gdb nvim /var/lib/systemd/coredump/core.nvim.1000.008a013d9f0d4e769d9dbcfdd9d9584a.13538.1656944479000000
(gdb) bt
```

ie.

1. Undo zstandard compression on root-owned core dump file.
2. Change ownership so that normal user can read file.
3. Relaunch executable (this time, `nvim`) with `gdb` and the core dump file.
4. Print the backtrace.

# `NULL` versus `NUL`

-   `NULL` is a "NULL pointer" (`((void *)0)`), defined in `<stddef.h>`.
-   `NUL` refers to the "NUL byte" (`'\0'`), used to terminate `NUL`-terminated strings.

Note that despite both being "zero" they have different sizes due to their use in different contexts; the `NULL` pointer will typically be a 64-bit or 32-bit value, while `NUL` will be an 8-bit `char`.

# Viewing generated assembly

Given a source file, `source.c`, produce output `source.s` with:

```bash
gcc -S source.c
```

# `assert()` and `abort()`

`assert(expression)` is a debugging and developmental aid that aborts the program unless `expression` is true. If `-DNDEBUG` is passed to the compiler, the entire construct is omitted. As such, for release builds, `assert()` calls can be considered to be "free".

`abort()` unconditionally terminates the program.

As a rule of thumb:

-   Use `assert()` to detect logic bugs, things that "should never happen", during development. In a sense, assertions exist not just to detect invalid assumptions, but to communicate what those assumptions are.
-   Use `abort()` for when things have gone catastrophically wrong, such that continuing isn't a viable option.
-   Neither of these is a substitute for handling _routine_ error states (for example, failure to read or write a file can happen for any number of reasons, and the program should very likely make some attempt at graceful recovery when this happens).

# `printf` format markers

From `man 3 printf`:

-   `%c`: `char`.
-   `%d`: `int` (printed as signed decimal).
    -   `%dl`: `long int` (printed as unsigned decimal).
    -   `%dl`: `long long int` (printed as unsigned decimal).
-   `%f`: `double`.
-   `%o`: `int` (printed as unsigned octal).
    -   `%oz`: `size_t` (printed as unsigned octal).
-   `%p`: `void *` (printed in hexadecimal).
-   `%s`: `NUL`-terminated string.
-   `%u`: `unsigned` (printed as unsigned decimal).
    -   `%ul`: `unsigned long` (printed as unsigned decimal).
    -   `%ull`: `unsigned long long` (printed as unsigned decimal).
    -   `%uz`: `size_t` (printed as unsigned decimal).
-   `%x`: `unsigned` (printed as unsigned hexadecimal).
    -   `%xl`: `unsigned long` (printed as unsigned hexadecimal).
    -   `%xll`: `unsigned long long` (printed as unsigned hexadecimal).
    -   `%xz`: `size_t` (printed as unsigned hexadecimal).
-   `%%`: literal `%`.

# `size_t`

On Darwin, this is equivalent to `unsigned long` (which nowadays means `uint64_t`, as [defined in `<stdint.h>`](https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/basedefs/stdint.h.html)), but in general a good heuristic for remembering _when_ to use this and _what_ it is:

-   Use it for things whose size is to be measured in bytes.
-   Its size is big enough to represent whatever the "biggest object" could be on the host system.
-   Technically, `size_t` [is defined, in `<stddef.h>`, as](https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/basedefs/stddef.h.html) the type of the result of the `sizeof()` operator.

# `sizeof`

-   `sizeof("string literal")` includes the trailing `NULL` byte; note this is different from `strlen()`, which returns the number of bytes _before_ the `NULL`.
-   `sizeof(0xff)` is equivalent to `sizeof(int)`; Clang will warn that this is suspicious, so if you really mean it you can write `sizeof(typeof(0xff))` instead.

# `ssize_t`

Signed equivalent of `size_t`.

Biggest possible value is `SSIZE_MAX`, defined in `<limits.h>`.

# `static` functions

A function declared with the `static` keyword is not visible outside of the translation unit in which it is defined.

# `static` variables

A variable defined with `static` _outside_ all functions is only visible inside its own translation unit. This is analogous to how `static` applies to functions.

A variable defined with `static` _inside_ a function maintains its value across invocations.
