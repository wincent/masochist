This page is a migration checksheet where I am keeping notes on the status of the server move from [[Rackspace]] to [[INetU]].

== [[DNS]] ==

* last of the domains and subdomains transferred on 28 March 2008; inspected with [[dig]] and everything looks correct

== [[Email]] ==

* last of the accounts and aliases transferred on 27 March 2008; tests show that incoming and outgoing mail is working
