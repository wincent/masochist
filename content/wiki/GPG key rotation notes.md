My current key isn't expiring until 2024-05-17, but I wanted to leave some notes here to remind me that the next time I transition to a new key I should create the master key without an expiry date and instead produce a key revocation certificate stored in a "safe location" (might be in a 1Password vault or printed on paper in a safe somewhere).
