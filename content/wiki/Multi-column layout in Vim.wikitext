= "Progammatic" technique =

I use this technique for "programmatically" rebalancing the three columns in the "AUTHORS" section of the [[Command-T]] documentation.

First, select the lines containing the author listing, then split it on the whitespace between the author names, producing a single-column list:

 :'<,'>s/\v  +/\r/g

Get rid of empty lines:

 gv
 :'<,'>g/^$/d

Sort the selection:

 gv
 :'<,'>sort

Use the `column` tool to form columns:

 gv
 :'<,'>!column -c 72

Convert tabs to spaces:

 :set tabstop=8
 gv
 :'<,'>retab

Indent the whole thing:

  gv
  >>

Put the tabstop back the way it was before:

 :set tabstop=2

''Note:'' the exact selection obtained by `gv` in these examples sometimes needs to be nudged up or down a line, but it is general close enough to what you want.

= As a macro =

Here's the above, recording as a macro, then assigned to a mapping, with some refinements:

<pre>vnoremap <leader>zc 
  \:s/\v^ +//g<CR>
  \gv:s/\v  +/\r/g<CR>
  \gvj:sort<CR>
  \V}k:!column -c 78<CR>
  \:set tabstop=8<CR>
  \V}:retab<CR>
  \gv>:noh<CR></pre>

= Manual technique =

The manual technique just has me making selections in visual block mode (`CTRL-V`) and manually deleting and moving sections.
