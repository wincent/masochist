# Current backup targets

-   [Arq](/wiki/Arq) backups of my personal files to:
    -   AWS.
-   [SuperDuper!](/wiki/SuperDuper%21) backups to encrypted external drive.
-   Critical files backed up to multiple, encrypted USB drives.

I've now reduced the number of Arq backup targets from 4 to 1, and added SuperDuper! back into the rotation due to concerns about putting too many eggs in the Arq basket (Arq has saved my hide on two occasions now, but I still run into bugs and have complaints about the UX, in addition to some of the [grave concerns raised here](https://web.archive.org/web/20180307021639/http://tomsmusings.twsheppard.com/2017/03/10/backup-software-that-doesnt-back-up-by-design/); basically, you could say that Arq — like democracy — is the worst possible backup solution out there, except all other backup solutions). Fast external hard drives are really tiny now and don't need separate power supplies, so I feel pretty ok about adding back the hardware requirement that I had previously liberated myself of.
