[Factory Girl](/wiki/Factory_Girl) is an "[object mother](/wiki/object_mother)" framework written in [Ruby](/wiki/Ruby). It plays nicely with [RSpec](/wiki/RSpec) and [Rails](/wiki/Rails).

I've been a Factory Girl user since mid-2010, after a long period using [FixtureReplacement](/wiki/FixtureReplacement). I switched principally because it doesn't pollute the global namespace with `create_model` methods, and it handles edge cases and associations very elegantly and powerfully.
