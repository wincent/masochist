These notes were made while upgrading from [[RSpec 1.0.3]] to [[RSpec 1.0.4]] on [[Mac OS X]] [[Tiger]].

Like the last upgrade (see "[[Upgrading to RSpec 1.0.3 on Mac OS X Tiger]]"), there was no corresponding [[Spec::UI]] upgrade.

= Pre-testing =

First double check that all [[specs]] are passing for [[Walrus]]. This is a good check because there are a ''lot'' of specifications, many of them containing numerous assertions:

<pre># from the top-level directory of the Walrus source tree:
rake spec</pre>

= Download and install =

<pre>sudo gem install rspec</pre>

== Output ==

<pre>Bulk updating Gem source index for: http://gems.rubyforge.org
Successfully installed rspec-1.0.4
Installing ri documentation for rspec-1.0.4...
Installing RDoc documentation for rspec-1.0.4...</pre>

= Update [[FastRI]] index =

<pre>fastri-server -b</pre>

== Output ==

<pre>Indexing RI docs for ParseTree version 1.7.0.
Indexing RI docs for RubyInline version 3.6.3.

Building index.

= Post-testing =

<pre># run the specs again
rake spec</pre>

= [[TextMate]] =

<pre>cd ~/Library/Application\ Support/TextMate/Bundles/RSpec.tmbundle
svn up</pre>

== Output ==

There were no changes since the last [[RSpec]] release:

<pre>At revision 2060.</pre>

== After updating ==

Normally, if [[TextMate]] is running, from the [[TextMate]] "Bundles" menu, open the "Bundle Editor" submenu and select "Reload Bundles". But in this case as there were no changes this should not be necessary.

= [[Rails]] =

I have a [[Rails]] project where [[rspec]] is installed as a plug-in. The <tt>--force</tt> switch is necessary in order to install over the previously installed copy:

<pre># from inside the Rails application top-level directory
script/plugin install --force svn://rubyforge.org/var/svn/rspec/tags/REL_1_0_4/rspec
script/plugin install --force svn://rubyforge.org/var/svn/rspec/tags/REL_1_0_4/rspec_on_rails</pre>

See if any other changes are necessary:

<pre>script/generate rspec --pretend</pre>

== Output ==

<pre>      exists  spec
overwrite spec/spec_helper.rb? [Ynaqd] d

So I decided to proceed with the change:

<pre>script/generate rspec</pre>

= Cleaning up old versions of installed [[gems]] =

I also took the opportunity to clean up some older versions of the installed [[gems]].

<pre>sudo gem cleanup</pre>

== Output ==
