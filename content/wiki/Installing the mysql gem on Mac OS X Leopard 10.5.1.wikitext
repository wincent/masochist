As noted in my [[Leopard set-up notes]], I couldn't get [[MySQL]] to build on [[Leopard]] 10.5.0, but I could with 10.5.1.

On upgrading to Rails 2.0RC2 (see "[[Upgrading to Rails 2.0RC2 on Mac OS X Leopard]]") I noticed that they'd added some instructions to the <tt>config/database.yml</tt> file for installing the mysql [[gem]] on Leopard:

<pre>sudo env ARCHFLAGS="-arch i386" gem install mysql -- --with-mysql-config=/usr/local/mysql/bin/mysql_config</pre>

Looks like this advice probably originated from [http://trac.macosforge.org/projects/ruby/wiki/Troubleshooting here].

But note, when I just did a plain <tt>./configure && make</tt> for MySQL, the <tt>mysql_config</tt> tool was ''not'' installed at that path, but at <tt>/usr/local/bin/mysql_config</tt> instead.

So, in my case, I had to do this (note the different value for <tt>--with-mysql-config</tt>):

<pre>$ sudo env ARCHFLAGS="-arch i386" gem install mysql -- --with-mysql-config=/usr/local/bin/mysql_config
Bulk updating Gem source index for: http://gems.rubyforge.org
Select which gem to install for your platform (universal-darwin9.0)
 1. mysql 2.7.3 (mswin32)
 2. mysql 2.7.1 (mswin32)
 3. mysql 2.7 (ruby)
 4. mysql 2.6 (ruby)
 5. Skip this gem
 6. Cancel installation

Successfully installed mysql-2.7</pre>

= Update =

Some time later I started seeing entries like this in my [[Rails]] logs:

<pre>WARNING: You're using the Ruby-based MySQL library that ships with Rails.
This library is not suited for production. Please install the C-based MySQL
library instead (gem install mysql).</pre>

Yet it does seem that it is installed:

<pre>$ gem list | grep mysql
mysql (2.7)</pre>

Given that a later version is available:

<pre>$ gem list --remote|grep mysql
activerecord-jdbcmysql-adapter (0.7.1, 0.7, 0.6)
do_mysql (0.2.3, 0.2.2, 0.2.1, 0.2.0)
jdbc-mysql (5.0.4)
mysql (2.7.3, 2.7.1, 2.7, 2.6, 2.5.1)
mysql_replication_adapter (0.4.0, 0.2.0, 0.1.1, 0.1.0)
mysql_retry_lost_connection (0.0.1)</pre>

I decided to proceeded with a reinstallation. My initial attempt naturally didn't work, as I had already forgotten about the workaround necessary to install the [[gem]] on [[Leopard]]:

<pre>$ sudo gem install mysql

A quick [[Google]] (too quick, seeing as I didn't find this page again reminding me that I'd already been through this once before!) suggested that I need to do the following, which also didn't work:

The <tt>install_name_tool</tt> trick doesn't seem to be necessary with this version of the [[gem]] because the reference to the <tt>libmysqlclient.15.dylib</tt> is already pointing to the right place:

<pre>bash-3.2# otool -L /usr/local/mysql/lib/mysql/libmysqlclient.15.0.0.dylib 
/usr/local/mysql/lib/mysql/libmysqlclient.15.0.0.dylib:

Points of interest:

* The warnings in the [[Rails]] log have gone away
* But notice that the reported version of the [[gem]] is still 2.7, just like the one that was already installed, and not 2.7.3 as is reported as being available by <tt>gem list --remote</tt>
