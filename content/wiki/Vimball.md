[Vimballs](/wiki/Vimballs) are files in the "[vimball](/wiki/vimball)" format which are intended to make installing and managing [Vim](/wiki/Vim) plugins easy.

The format was created by Charles Campbell, and the plugin for working with vimballs is available from [here](http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=1502). The plugin is included with all recent versions of [Vim](/wiki/Vim).
