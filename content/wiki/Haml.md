[Haml](/wiki/Haml) or [HTML Abstraction Markup Language](/wiki/HTML_Abstraction_Markup_Language) is an alternative templating engine for [Rails](/wiki/Rails) that aims to provide:

-   [DRY](/wiki/DRY), concise, well-indented, attractive markup
-   Rigorously correct [XHTML](/wiki/XHTML) output

Why a new templating system for [Rails](/wiki/Rails)? I think [this quote](http://unspace.ca/discover/haml/) best sums it up:

> Ruby on Rails pushes so many boundaries: RJS, migrations, and partials were new concepts that blew our minds, and made other platforms try to catch up. RHTML didn't blow your mind at all; it's just JSP/ASP/PHP/etc all over again. Boring! Rails deserves a ground-breaking templating language.
