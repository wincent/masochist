For years now I've used my <tt>~/.bash_profile</tt> to give me a custom, colorized [[Bash]] prompt and show the current working directory in the title bar of the [[Terminal]].

= 2003 solution =

<pre># colours for use in prompts
RED="\[\e[0;31m\]"
GREEN="\[\e[0;32m\]"
BLUE="\[\e[0;34m\]"
NOCOLOR="\[\e[0m\]"

#
# Prompt                                                
#

OPENTITLEBAR="\[\033]0;"
CLOSETITLEBAR="\007\]"

TITLEBAR="${OPENTITLEBAR}\w${CLOSETITLEBAR}"

PROMPT="${GREEN}\h:${BLUE}\W${RED}\$ ${NOCOLOR}"

export PS1="${TITLEBAR}${PROMPT}"

function set_title ()
{
  echo -n -e "\033]0;$*\007"
}</pre>

= 2007 solution =

On seeing [http://www.macosxhints.com/article.php?story=20070628002730528 this hint] I learned that my old hack (customizing the title from within the prompt) was no longer necessary:

<pre>#
# Prompt                                                
#

PROMPT="${GREEN}\h:${BLUE}\W${RED}\$ ${NOCOLOR}"
export PS1="${PROMPT}"

#
# Title bar
#

OPENTITLEBAR="\033]0;"
CLOSETITLEBAR="\007"

trap 'printf "${OPENTITLEBAR} `history 1 | cut -b8-` - `pwd` ${CLOSETITLEBAR}"' DEBUG</pre>

So as before I show the current working directory in the title bar, but now I also add the last/current job. This makes the window titles much more informative. Note that this is better than the option provided by the [[Terminal]] itself to show the current process in the title bar. A quick example will illustrate why:

Using the customization as defined above I will see a string like "less example.txt" in the title bar if I am currently using <tt>less</tt> to view a document, <tt>example.txt</tt>. Using the built-in support in the [[Terminal]] I will only see "less", which isn't as informative.

Likewise, with the customization if I type a command which exits immediately, like <tt>ls -laF</tt>, then I'll see the corresponding string in the title bar ("ls -laF") even after the command has exited, but with the built-in support I will only see "ls" instantaneously and then the title bar will revert to displaying "bash" which is not very helpful for distinguishing multiple windows.

Upon logging into a remote site via [[SSH]] my title changes to a string such as "username@host", because on the remote host I have a <tt>$PROMPT_COMMAND</tt> variable which overrides the local trap. This is a good thing as the primary characteristic I am interested in for such remote sessions is knowing which host they belong to.
