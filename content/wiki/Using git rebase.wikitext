= Basic use case =

<pre># create a topic branch based on current master
git checkout -b my_cool_new_feature

# work on feature...
vi file
git add file
git commit -s

# meanwhile, someone else has made changes to master...
git checkout master
git pull

# now rebase so that your topic branch applies on top of current HEAD of master
git checkout my_cool_new_feature
git rebase master

# fix any conflicts that may be discovered on the way
vi file
git add file
git commit -s

# resume the rebase
git rebase --continue

# rebase done, prepare patch set based on topic branch
git format-patch master

# alternatively, just merge it in locally
git checkout master
git merge my_cool_new_feature
git branch -d my_cool_new_feature

# and propagate it back out to the origin
git push</pre>
