[Micronaut](/wiki/Micronaut) is [Ruby](/wiki/Ruby) testing framework written as a lightweight, [API](/wiki/API)-compatible alternative to [RSpec](/wiki/RSpec). The project was compelling enough that it was used as a basis for [RSpec 2](/wiki/RSpec_2) (effectively a ground-up rewrite of the original [RSpec](/wiki/RSpec)).
