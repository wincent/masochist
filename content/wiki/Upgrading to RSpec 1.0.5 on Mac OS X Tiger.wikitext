These notes were made while upgrading from [[RSpec 1.0.4]] to [[RSpec 1.0.5]] on [[Mac OS X]] [[Tiger]].

Once gain, like the last upgrade (see "[[Upgrading to RSpec 1.0.4 on Mac OS X Tiger]]"), there was no corresponding [[Spec::UI]] upgrade.

= Pre-testing =

First double check that all [[specs]] are passing for [[Walrus]]. This is a good check because there are a ''lot'' of specifications, many of them containing numerous assertions:

<pre># from the top-level directory of the Walrus source tree:
rake spec</pre>

= Download and install =

<pre>sudo gem install rspec</pre>

== Output ==

<pre>Bulk updating Gem source index for: http://gems.rubyforge.org

Installing RDoc documentation for rspec-1.0.5...</pre>

= Update [[FastRI]] index =

<pre>fastri-server -b</pre>

= Post-testing =

<pre># run the specs again
rake spec</pre>

= [[TextMate]] =

This time seeing as I had [http://wincent.com/a/about/wincent/weblog/archives/2007/05/rspec_changes.php some local changes] to my [[TextMate]] bundle I didn't want to perform the normal upgrade procedure:

<pre>cd ~/Library/Application\ Support/TextMate/Bundles/RSpec.tmbundle
svn up</pre>

Instead, I wanted to preview what the <tt>svn up</tt> would do before actually trying it (see '[[Previewing an "svn up" without actually doing it]]' for more info):

<pre># see uncommitted differences in my working copy
svn st

# see differences between my working copy and the current head
svn diff -r HEAD

# proceed with the update
svn up</pre>

== Output ==

<pre>U    Support/lib/spec_mate.rb
U    Support/spec/fixtures/example_failing_spec.rb
U    Support/spec/fixtures/example_passing_spec.rb
U    Support/spec/spec_mate_spec.rb
Updated to revision 2085.</pre>

== After updating ==

Normally, if [[TextMate]] is running, from the [[TextMate]] "Bundles" menu, open the "Bundle Editor" submenu and select "Reload Bundles".

= [[Rails]] =

I have a [[Rails]] project where [[rspec]] is installed as a plug-in. The <tt>--force</tt> switch is necessary in order to install over the previously installed copy. I decided to change from using specific tags this time, so instead of:

<pre># from inside the Rails application top-level directory
script/plugin install --force svn://rubyforge.org/var/svn/rspec/tags/REL_1_0_5/rspec
script/plugin install --force svn://rubyforge.org/var/svn/rspec/tags/REL_1_0_5/rspec_on_rails</pre>

I did:

<pre>script/plugin install --force svn://rubyforge.org/var/svn/rspec/tags/CURRENT/rspec
script/plugin install --force svn://rubyforge.org/var/svn/rspec/tags/CURRENT/rspec_on_rails</pre>

See if any other changes are necessary:

<pre>script/generate rspec --pretend</pre>

There were no substantive changes (previewable by hitting <tt>d</tt>) so I opted not to replace any files (by hitting <tt>n</tt>).

= Cleaning up old versions of installed [[gems]] =

I also took the opportunity to clean up some older versions of the installed [[gems]].

<pre>sudo gem cleanup</pre>

== Output ==

<pre>Cleaning up installed gems...
Attempting uninstall on rspec-1.0.4
Successfully uninstalled rspec version 1.0.4
Clean Up Complete</pre>

For more information on removing old [[gems]], see "[[Removing older versions of installed gems]]".
