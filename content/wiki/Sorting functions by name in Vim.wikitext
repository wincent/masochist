This can be tricky. The basic idea is:

# Collapse each function onto one line (note that you can only do this if you have a non-ambiguous way of identifying the beginning and end of each function)
# Sort the one-liners
# Expand the one-liners back into multi-line form

The trick here is to use a unique marker to represent newlines (eg. `@@@`) so that they can be correctly restored.

= Example =

Given some JavaScript methods in an object:

<pre lang="javascript">
const methods = {
  foo() {
    // contents
  },

  bar() {
    // contents
  },

  baz() {
    // contents
  },
};</pre>

Here we can make a pattern that identifies the start of each method (in this case, `) {`; but note, if we had `if` statements or similar inside the methods we'd need to come up with something more specific, like `() {` or something more complicated).

Likewise, we can identify the end of each method by looking for `},`.

So, with that in mind:

<pre>" select range to be sorted, then:
:g/\v\) \{/,/\v\},/ s/$\n/@@@
" (Vim expands that to: `:'<,'>g/\v\) \{/,/\v\},/ s/$\n/@@@`

" Then select the lines and:
:sort
" (Vim expands that to: `:'<,'>sort`)

" Then select the lines and split back onto multiple lines again:
:s/@@@/\r/g
" (Vim expands that to: `:'<,'>s/@@@/\r/g`)</pre>
