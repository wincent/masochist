This is a list of [[Vim]] plugins which I find useful and robust enough to warrant recommending them.

['''Disclaimer:''' This list is massively out of date. See [https://github.com/wincent/wincent/ my dotfiles repo] for a more accurate reflection of what I'm using.]

= Switching between buffers =

* minibufexpl.vim: http://vim.sourceforge.net/scripts/script.php?script_id=159
* a.vim: http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=31 (opens alternate files; header and source files, for example)

= Project and file system browsing =

* [[Command-T]] (written by me)
* [[fuzzyfinder.vim]]: http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=1984
* NERD Tree: http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=1658

== Retired from service ==

These are plug-ins which I tried out for a while but eventually got rid of due to [/blog/fuzzyfinder insatisfaction]:

* fuzzy_file_finder (similar to `Command-T` in [[TextMate]]): http://github.com/jamis/fuzzy_file_finder/tree/master
* fuzzyfinder_textmate (extends Fuzzyfinder to use fuzzy_file_finder): http://github.com/jamis/fuzzyfinder_textmate/tree/master

= Editing =

== Manipulating spans ==

* surround.vim: http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=1697

This plug-in is great for doing things like converting single quotes to double quotes with: `cs'"`

* repeat.vim: http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=2136

Complementary to `surround.vim`, `repeat.vim` allows plugins to hook into the repeat command (`.`) so that the entire action performed by a plug-in mapping can be repeated rather than just the last command that was executed inside the function.

== Commenting ==

* The NERD Commenter: http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=1218

== Snippets ==

* XP Template: http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=2611

= [[Rails]] =

* rails.vim: http://github.com/tpope/vim-rails (see also http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=1567)
