= For the impatient =

Once the initial set-up is done, it's a simple matter of:

<pre># given local user $GIT_USER, $GITORIOUS_PROJECT, and $GITORIOUS_REPO
cd /path/to/repo
sudo -u $GIT_USER git remote add --mirror gitorious git@gitorious.org:$GITORIOUS_PROJECT/$GITORIOUS_REPO

# either wait for the cron job to propagate the changes, or...
sudo -u $GIT_USER -s -H
git push gitorious</pre>

= Set-up =

Most of the set-up is described in "[[Setting up backup (mirror) repositories on GitHub]]". I'm using the same public key that I described on that page under "Setting up a private/public key pair".

I also added a block like this to my `~/.ssh/config`; it's not strictly necessary but I think it's nice to be explicit:

 Host gitorious.org
   IdentityFile /path/to/git/home/.ssh/id_dsa
   HostName gitorious.org
   User git

With this set-up in place you have the option of specifying the repository using:

 gitorious.org:wopublic/wopublic.git

Instead of the longer:

 git@gitorious.org:wopublic/wopublic.git

= Creating the new repository on Gitorious =

# Click on the "[http://gitorious.org/projects All Projects]" link
# Click the "[http://gitorious.org/projects/new Create a New Project]" button
# Enter:
## Title (for example "WOHotKey")
## Slug (for example "wohotkey")
## Categories (for example "objective-c mac-os-x")
## License (for example "BSD License")
## Home URL (for example, http://git.wincent.com/WOHotKey.git)
## Bugtracker URL (for example, https://wincent.com/issues/)
# Disable the wiki
# Provide a Description (for example, "Mirror of the official WOHotKey repository at git.wincent.com")
# Click on "Create project"

Now create a new repository:

# Fill in:
## Name (for example, "WOHotKey")
## Description (for example, "Mirror of the official WOHotKey repository at git.wincent.com")
