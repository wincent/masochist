[37signals](/wiki/37signals) is a [Web 2.0](/wiki/Web_2.0) company principally of interest because it is where the [Ruby on Rails](/wiki/Ruby_on_Rails) web application framework was first developed. One of its unfortunate legacies are the swarms of copycat sites that have adopted the number-plus-noun convention for choosing a domain name.
