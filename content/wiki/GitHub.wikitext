Not to be confused with [[Git]] (currently the most popular [[distributed version control system]]) itself, [[GitHub]] is a private company that sells Git repository hosting.

GitHub hosts open source projects for free, but GitHub itself is proprietary code.

Free and [[open source]] alternatives to GitHub include [[Gitorious]], and Git itself, which includes tools for hosting your own repositories using your own infrastructure.
