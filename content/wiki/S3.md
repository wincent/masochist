[S3](/wiki/S3) or the [Amazon Simple Storage Service](/wiki/Amazon_Simple_Storage_Service) is part of Amazon's [cloud](/wiki/cloud) computing offering, [Amazon Web Services](/wiki/Amazon_Web_Services).

The abbreviation is the result of turning "[Simple Storage Service](/wiki/Simple_Storage_Service)" into an acronym, SSS, and then replacing the run of repeated "Ss" with "S3" (in other words "S three times").
