An "[object mother](/wiki/object_mother)" is a test fixture replacement.

There are many, many fixture replacements available for [Ruby](/wiki/Ruby). So many, in fact, that it looks like some sort of obligatory induction ritual that every Ruby programmer must undergo in order to become a fully-fledged developer.

FixtureReplacement was one of the first and I used it since very soon after it came out.

In mid-2010 I started looking into Factory Girl as an alternative, as it seemed to be one of the most complete solutions, with a lot of support of tricky edge cases. Soon after I switched over to it definitively.

Machinist looks to have a nicer-looking, more elegant DSL than Factory Girl.
