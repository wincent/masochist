[Gitorious](/wiki/Gitorious) provided free [Git](/wiki/Git) hosting for [open source](/wiki/open_source) projects. It was a free, open source alternative to the free-but-proprietary [GitHub](/wiki/GitHub).

I used to use it to host mirrored copies of the repos at git.wincent.com.

In March 2015 [it was announced](https://about.gitlab.com/2015/03/03/gitlab-acquires-gitorious/) that Gitorious had been acquired by GitLab and would shut down at the end of May 2015.
