Version 3.5.1a of [Synergy](/wiki/Synergy), the lightweight, highly-customizable [iTunes](/wiki/iTunes) controller is now available. This is the latest release in the alpha/experimental series.

This release adds the ability to temporarily disable [last.fm](/wiki/last.fm) submissions via a checkbox in the "Advanced" tab of the preferences (closes feature [request \#1310](/issues/1310)); this is great for those times when you don't want what you're listening to to be "scrobbled" to the website, but you don't want to permanently disable the last.fm features of Synergy.

A full changelog appears [here](http://wincent.com/a/products/synergy-classic/history/#3.5.1a).

You can download the new release from [the download page](http://wincent.com/a/products/synergy-classic/download/) ([direct link](http://wincent.com/download.php?item=SynergyBeta.zip)) and purchase a license using [this page](https://secure.wincent.com/a/products/synergy-classic/purchase/). Please note that 3.5.1a is not a free update for users who received a free copy of Synergy as part of the MacHeist Giving Tree bundle (see the [MacHeist FAQ](/blog/frequently-asked-questions-about-synergy-and-macheist) for more information).

Also of note was the release of 3.4 (stable series) last week. If you're curious about the difference between the two series and would like to know which one you should use, please see my [blog](/blog) post, "[Clearing up confusion about Synergy version numbers](/blog/clearing-up-confusion-about-synergy-version-numbers)".
