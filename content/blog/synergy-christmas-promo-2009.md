To celebrate the 2009 festive season, if you purchase a [Synergy](/products/synergy) license between now and the end of the year you'll have the option of receiving an additional, complementary license as a free gift for a recipient of your choice.

To take advantage of the offer, just [purchase a Synergy license](https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_xclick&business=win@wincent.com&item_name=Synergy+for+Mac+OS+X+10.2+and+later&amount=5.00&no_note=1&currency_code=EUR&lc=GB) and then send me an email (to <win@wincent.com>) containing the following information:

1.  The date of purchase
2.  The email address you used when purchasing
3.  The email address of the person who should receive the free gift license
4.  Any special instructions or message that you would like included along with the free license

As I have to process these requests manually, there may be a delay of up to one business day between receiving your request and the gift license being sent to the recipient. Thanks for participating in the promotion, and happy holiday season to all.
