title: Half-star ratings in iTunes
tags: blog
---

I just noticed that the latest version of [iTunes](http://www.apple.com/itunes/overview/) ([6.0.2](http://www.apple.com/pr/library/2006/jan/10ilife.html)) now displays half-star ratings in the UI. Question: How do you *set* half-star ratings? Answer: With [Synergy Advance](http://www.wincent.com/a/products/synergy-advance/). I've added [an entry](http://www.wincent.com/a/products/synergy-advance/faq/#half-stars) to [the FAQ](http://www.wincent.com/a/products/synergy-advance/faq/) explaining how to do this.

Here's a screen shot of the development version of Synergy Advance displaying half-star ratings using Growl notifications (this is version 0.3 which will be released shortly).
