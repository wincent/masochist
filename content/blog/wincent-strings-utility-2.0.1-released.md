This is a tiny update to [Wincent Strings Utility](/wiki/Wincent_Strings_Utility), following on from the release of 2.0 [yesterday](/blog/wincent-strings-utility-2.0-released). The only significant change is that using the installer package on versions of [Mac OS X](/wiki/Mac_OS_X) older than 10.6 [Snow Leopard](/wiki/Snow_Leopard) will now trigger a dialog explaining the system version requirement. Also, the source distribution now includes the [buildtools](/wiki/buildtools) submodule so that it doesn't have to be fetched separately.

Wincent Strings Utility is a [command-line](/wiki/command-line) tool designed to help developers with the task of localization. [This plaintext copy of the manpage](http://wincent.com/a/products/wincent-strings-util/wincent-strings-util.1.txt) describes its different modes of operation.

This release will *only* run on [Snow Leopard](/wiki/Snow_Leopard), but older versions of the software which will work on older versions of [Mac OS X](/wiki/Mac_OS_X) are still available from [strings.wincent.com](http://strings.wincent.com/).

You can download the [installer package](http://wincent.com/a/products/wincent-strings-util/download/wincent-strings-util-2.0.1.zip), [source tarball](http://wincent.com/a/products/wincent-strings-util/download/wincent-strings-util-2.0.1-src.tar.gz), or check out the [official product page](http://strings.wincent.com/) for information about obtaining the source via [Git](/wiki/Git). An online repository browser is also available [here](http://git.wincent.com/wincent-strings-util.git).
