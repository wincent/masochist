My machine has been pretty kind to me lately; it's been quite a while since [the last](/blog/involuntary-reboot-log-51) [involuntary reboot](/wiki/involuntary_reboot). This one wasn't a software or hardware fault; rather, somebody was messing with the power cables, interrupting my "[UPS](/wiki/UPS)" and causing a hard reset.

This is the first time in a while that my "average time between failures" has actually gone *up* rather than down.

-   Kernel panics: 26
-   Hard resets: 26
-   Total failures: 52
-   Start of recording keeping: 21 May 2006
-   Total days to date: 1046 days
-   Average time between failures: 20.12 days
