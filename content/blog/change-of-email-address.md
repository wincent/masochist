title: Change of email address
tags: blog

At the end of June this year I will be changing my email address. I wanted to post this article to give people plenty of notice. I'm doing this for two reasons.

Firstly, because my old address, *win@wincent.org*, has been plastered all over the Internet for about 7 years now and it attracts a fair amount of spam. Even with good filtering, the quantity is annoying because I still have to scan the filtered mail for false positives.

Secondly, I registered wincent.org in 1999 but since obtaining wincent.com (not sure exactly when, I think it was in 2002 or 2003) I have gradually been moving more and more aspects of my business over to the dot-com domain. It makes sense that outgoing mail should come from dot-com and not dot-org.

So until the end of June this year I will continue to accept delivery at the old address. After that I will probably start bouncing mail and including the URL for [the contact form](http://www.wincent.com/a/contact/mail/) in the bounce message.

Effective immediately, all outgoing email will be coming from the new address. The new address is the same as the old address, except it's dot-com rather than dot-org. An updated copy of my PEM email certificate (encryption and signature verification) has been added to [this page](http://www.wincent.com/a/about/wincent/).
