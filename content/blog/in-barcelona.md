I'm in Barcelona for the weekend and have just organized 24 hours of WiFi access so that I can work from the hotel room and check in changes when necessary. Some of the work I want to do involves branching and merging so it's really an online thing.

I've got my trusty old G4 laptop with me, now almost three years old but it's still serving me well, if a little slowly. The 12" form factor really is a delight when you're travelling. In any case, this machine has a skeletal Leopard install on it and isn't set up for email or anything like that, so please be aware that I won't be able to reply to any inquiries that get sent in during the weekend. I'm looking at switching things over to Objective-C 2.0 with garbage collection and properties, for starters. Should be fun.

The usual avenues for getting automated support are available 24 hours a day — things like getting your license codes remailed to you and such — and the instructions are [the same as the last time](http://www.wincent.com/a/news/archives/2006/08/wincent_away_fr.php) I was away.
