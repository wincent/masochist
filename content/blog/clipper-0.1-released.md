[Clipper](/wiki/Clipper) is an [OS X](/wiki/OS_X) "launch agent" that runs in the background providing a service that exposes the local clipboard to [tmux](/wiki/tmux) sessions and other processes running both locally and remotely.

A binary download (for OS X 10.8 [Mountain Lion](/wiki/Mountain_Lion)) can be found on the [Clipper product page](/products/clipper).

For more details, see [the 0.1 README](http://git.wincent.com/clipper.git/blob/a36d3601b21ea9938ed97203d7973bd5e8436625:/README.md).

**Update:** I've added a screencast to the [Clipper product page](/products/clipper) demonstrating what it can do.
