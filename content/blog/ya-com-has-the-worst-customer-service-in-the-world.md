title: Ya.com has the worst customer service in the world

So [my battle with Ya.com](http://www.wincent.com/a/about/wincent/weblog/archives/2006/02/yacom_incompete.php) continues. Another month, another incorrect bill in which they have charged me double, another letter of complaint. It's funny (har, har, it is to laugh) seeing how my language has changed with each successive letter of complaint.

#### Letter 1: Polite

> I don't see any reason why Ya.com shouldn't be able to resolve this matter to my satisfaction, and if they do then they will have won my loyalty as a customer in the future. If they don't then they will have lost me as a client forever.

#### Letter 2: Annoyed

> In summary, the service provided by Ya.com and its handling of this complaint have been up until now disgraceful.

#### Letter 3: Pissed off

> The fact that this figure is double the most expensive plan currently published on Ya.com's website, given that I am a client that fulfilled the terms of his contract many months ago, and that my repeated complaints have gone unheeded is nothing less than an insult to my intelligence. In summary, the service provided by Ya.com and its handling of this complaint have been up until now frankly *disgraceful*, the worst I have ever had the misfortune to encounter.

I wonder what Letter 4 will be like, if there is one (and knowing Ya.com, there will be.... grrrrrrr....).
