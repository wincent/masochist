I expect to be releasing a lot of product updates over the coming days to coincide with the release of the new version of [Mac OS X](/wiki/Mac_OS_X), [Snow Leopard](/wiki/Snow_Leopard). The first of these is [Wincent Strings Utility](/wiki/Wincent_Strings_Utility) version 2.0. Wincent Strings Utility is a [command-line](/wiki/command-line) tool designed to help developers with the task of localization. [This plaintext copy of the manpage](http://wincent.com/a/products/wincent-strings-util/wincent-strings-util.1.txt) describes its different modes of operation.

Note that this release will *only* run on [Snow Leopard](/wiki/Snow_Leopard), but older versions of the software which will work on older versions of [Mac OS X](/wiki/Mac_OS_X) are still available from [strings.wincent.com](http://strings.wincent.com/). At the moment this system version requirement is not strictly enforced by the installer package, but I plan on doing a follow-up release which does this shortly.

You can download the [installer package](http://wincent.com/a/products/wincent-strings-util/download/wincent-strings-util-2.0.pkg.zip), [source tarball](http://wincent.com/a/products/wincent-strings-util/download/wincent-strings-util-2.0-src.tar.gz), or check out the [official product page](http://strings.wincent.com/) for information about obtaining the source via [Git](/wiki/Git). An online repository browser is also available [here](http://git.wincent.com/wincent-strings-util.git).

This is an [open source](/wiki/open_source) product licensed under the [GPL](/wiki/GPL), so if you find it useful please consider [making a donation](https://www.paypal.com/xclick/business=win@wincent.com&item_name=Wincent+Strings+Utility+donation&no_note=1&currency_code=EUR&lc=GB).
