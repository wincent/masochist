title: An Xcode feature request

Xcode has toolbar buttons for "Clean", "Clean All", "Build", "Build and Run" and so forth. Many, many times each day I find myself pressing "Clean" and then "Build" immediately afterwards. It would be a nice convenience and time saver if there was a "Clean and Build" button that combined the two operations, or failing that, if holding the Option key down while pressing the "Build" or "Build and Run" (or even the "Build and Debug") buttons could modify their behaviour to execute a clean before proceeding with the build.
