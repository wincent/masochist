The beta-testing period is over and [Synergy](/wiki/Synergy), the lightweight, highly-customizable [iTunes](/wiki/iTunes) controller has been updated to version 4.0.1. The 4.0 series is a brand new line of development especially for [Mac OS X](/wiki/Mac_OS_X) 10.6 [Snow Leopard](/wiki/Snow_Leopard).

This release has been tested with the new-released iTunes 9.0.0, and given feedback on the stability of the last release moves from "beta" to "final" status.

Note that the 4.0 series will *only* run on [Snow Leopard](/wiki/Snow_Leopard). (Version 3.4.1, the last release in the stable series will run on all versions of Mac OS X from 10.2.8 upwards.) A full changelog appears [here](/products/synergy/history).
