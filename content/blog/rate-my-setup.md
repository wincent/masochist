title: Rate my setup
---

For the first time since forever I'm actually happy with my current desk setup, so I thought I'd go back and look for some photos of older setups and rate them.

# 2010 edition

On display we have an [iMac "Core i5" 2.66 27" (Late 2009)](https://everymac.com/systems/apple/imac/specs/imac-core-i5-2.66-27-inch-aluminum-late-2009-specs.html), some [Harman Kardon SoundSticks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SoundSticks), an Apple keyboard, and a LaCie external drive sitting on a glass IKEA desktop and a crappy plastic chair. Amusingly, the LaCie is sitting on a foam block to dampen the noise caused by the vibrations from the spinning HDD platters. A Blue Snowball mic can be spotted sitting up on a shelf above the desk.

Start-up life, part 1. The Apple keyboard is now accompanied by a "Magic" Trackpad, and we see a MacBook Air next to a decidedly-not-4K Dell monitor (to which is taped a picture of a US keyboard layout because my brain was trying to recover after being rewired when using Spanish layout keyboards). In a minor concession to ergonomics, the monitor is raised close to a suitable height by sitting on a ream of paper, but it's not centered in front of the keyboard, something I'd never tolerate now.

Part 2. The start-up life intensifies, with an Aeron chair and a crankable standing desk (horridly unsafe, BTW, with a bespoke mechanism). The LaCie has again joined me on the desk, but this time without the foam dampening block. In typical VC-funded bubble fashion, I've gone from a single ream of paper to six whole reams, significantly improving the ergonomics of the setup by center-aligning the monitor and elevating the laptop (that's what the two reams on the right are for).

# 2015 edition

Fast-forward to 2015 and I just moved into [this fancy building at FB](https://arquitecturaviva.com/works/facebook-campus-in-menlo-park) along with the rest of Product Infrastructure. You get a standing desk! And you get a standing desk! _You_ get a standing desk! Also, an "ergo consult" where they give you a real laptop stand and make sure your keyboard (now [a Realforce](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topre)) and display are at the right height. Some kind of Apple Monitor — I don't remember exactly which — but at that time it wasn't a 4K or Retina one. Some fun details in there, if you look closely, like a React logo leant casually against a desk, a glimpse of the corner of Zuck's "Acquarium" office in the background, and Joe Savona intently ripping through some some god-level-hard problem, as is his wont.

One pandemic later, working from home — at the kitchen table, no less — in another country. The keyboard is the same, but everything else is different. A new employer, new headphones, a shitty 5€ mouse (not even cordless), and an unfortunate new era of Apple laptops without ports (see the dongle) but with horrible butterfly switch keyboards and useless "Touch Bars".

# 2021 edition

Still working from home, but now from the living room, and another employer. We're still afflicted with a cursed Touch Bar, but we have awesome Apple Silicon now. Note that the "upgrade"[^upgrade] from the kitchen table to a dedicated but non-adjustable standing desk requires an ingenious new laptop stand[^judge] while I send my intermittently faulty monitor away for warranty repair or replacement.

[^upgrade]: "Upgrade" in quotes because it was a horrible, low quality thing made out of the cheapest, warped wood. I got it because it was the just pleasing enough, aesthetically speaking, that I could hope to put in the living room without becoming the most unpopular member of the household. In the end, I think I _did_ become the most unpopular member anyway, but that's all water under the bridge now.
[^judge]: Don't judge me for my taste in books. My then-employer gave me a learning budget every year, and I ended up buying a _ton_ of books. The ones in the photo were just the ones that happened to be the right height for my needs.

# 2023 edition

Better view of the same desk. Ignore the cardboard boxes (this was a moving day). Not too much has changed at this point, but I have acquired a few accessories, like a "Blue Yeti" mic and mount, and an Elgato ring light: both of those were principally chosen on the not-so-sound basis of being actually available (things got scarce in the pandemic), and I wanted to put my employer's "home office" budget to use. Also visible: [new headphones](https://www.sony.com/lr/electronics/headband-headphones/wh-1000xm4), better in many ways, and my trusty Linux desktop.

# 2025 edition

I'm not quite ready to show this yet, but I think I'm actually happy with my setup for the first time since basically _forever_. I've still got the ridiculous ring light, but that's about the only thing that's out of place any more. I now have an adjustable desk! I actually have a chair! I got rid of the rather mediocre Blue mic and upgraded to a nicer Røde one. I replaced my 4K monitor with a 5K one (a Retina-ish external display, finally). [New headphones](https://www.bose.com/p/headphones/quietcomfort-acoustic-noise-cancelling-headphones/QC-HEADPHONEARN.html)[^unsure], courtesy of my employer. I even have a desk mat now to put the keyboard and trackpad. Not sharing a photo at this time because of one small problem: it's in the corner of the living room and I don't really have a good angle on it.

[^unsure]: To be honest, I am not sure which QuietComfort model I've got, but whichever one it is, the sound is great and the UX is good too.
