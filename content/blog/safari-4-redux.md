title: Safari 4 redux

So, [Safari](/wiki/Safari) has been out for a while now so I thought I'd revisit my [original comments](/safari-4-comments) on the beta.

From the "Stuff I'm pleased with" list:

-   **Tabs on top:** were unfortunately removed from the final version.
-   **Full history search:** turned out to be just as awesome expected, as did the **Smart search field**.
-   **Top Sites:** is indeed gimicky but fun.
-   **Full page zoom:** definitely makes it much easier to create pages which look good at all zoom levels, and brings Safari into line with [Firefox](/wiki/Firefox)'s behaviour.
-   **Speculative loading:** can't say I've noticed it yet.
-   **Acid 3 compliance:** hard to feel the tangible effects of this but any advance towards standards compliance must be good for the web as a platform.
-   **Native Windows look and feel:** Haven't even tried it on Windows yet...

From the "Stuff that sucks" list:

-   **"Smart" Address Field:** Unlike in the beta screenshots, it actually *is* smart and doesn't hide [URLs](/wiki/URLs). Definitely doesn't suck any more.

From the "Stuff I'm indifferent about" list:

-   **Nitro engine:** I'm programming more in [JavaScript](/wiki/JavaScript) nowadays and as web applications become more complex I think we'll appreciate this more and more.
-   **Cover Flow:** this turns out to be pretty darn useful while searching the history.
-   **HTML 5 offline support:** Haven't even looked at it yet.

All in all, I think they've done a fantastic job. The new version is fast, slick, solid, and has some very nice features and [UI](/wiki/UI) polish to boot.
