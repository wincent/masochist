title: Rails update headaches
tags: rails

In [https://wincent.com/blog/lack-of-stability-in-the-rails-ruby-ecosystem-rant my rant] from the other day I was complaining about how trying to build an application on top of Rails and friends is like building on quicksand.

Let me provide a little bit of illustration from my current battle in moving from 2.2.2 to 2.3.0 RC1.

I don't have the time or the patience to go back and data-mine my development history charting the pain and suffering that each Rails update brings with it, but here is just a quick sampling obtained with `git oneline --grep='[Rr]ails'` (`oneline` is an alias for `log --pretty=oneline --abbrev-commit`).

Unfortunately these one-line commit subjects can't really hope to communicate the misspent time, frustration, and annoyance at doing mindless "busy work" rather than working on useful features and ''application'' (not ''framework'') bug fixes.

''Rails 2.3.0 RC1:''

''Rails 2.1.0 RC1:''

<pre>49e4217... Update application controller specs for Rails 2.1
c2ac696... Fix Rails load ordering of frozen gems
e1fe380... Fixes for Rails gems dependencies
a73e850... Update to Rails 2.1.0_RC1</pre>

I was quite surprised when updating to 2.3.0 RC1 that all the specs continued to pass. One should never count one's chickens before they've hatched, however, as I have run into a couple of issues despite the fact that the spec suite passed. I ''do'' have a lot of specs ("1019 examples, 0 failures, 23 pending"), but evidently you can never have enough...

The three unresolved issues that are currently robbing me of time that I would rather be spending on something else are:

# My cache sweepers stopped getting auto-loaded in 2.3.0: http://groups.google.com/group/rubyonrails-talk/browse_thread/thread/323ff7ec2d95ee32/ab33ad8c16b300e5
# Haml started complaining (not sure whether this is a bug in Haml, or provoked by a change in Rails): http://groups.google.com/group/haml/browse_thread/thread/d4902a4d4d5de5aa
# Atom feeds rendered using Builder templates are busted (they're being rendered inside the application HTML template): http://groups.google.com/group/rubyonrails-talk/browse_thread/thread/d2d150c8219e5814

Now, none of these issues are show-stoppers. They're either harmless or have known workarounds. But that doesn't make them any less annoying. They're time wasters. And every kludgey little fix that you use to wallpaper over the cracks is another layer of crud that accumulates in your app. Another blemish in the code base, brittle and fragile, waiting to be re-broken in a future update.
