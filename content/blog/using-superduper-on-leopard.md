title: Using SuperDuper! on Leopard
---

So I've been using [SuperDuper!](http://www.wincent.com/knowledge-base/SuperDuper!) on [Leopard](http://www.wincent.com/knowledge-base/Leopard) despite the fact that it is [officially not compatible](http://www.shirt-pocket.com/SuperDuper/SuperDuperDescription.html). In fact, I didn't actually *know* it wasn't compatible until I went to the Shirt Pocket website in search of an explanation as to why my "Smart Updates" weren't so "Smart" anymore (basically, instead of copying across only new and modified files, each backup resulted in basically *all* files being copied across again).

So there are glitches but it "works" in a limited way (no crashes, the backup actually completes, but I haven't tested to see if the backup is bootable and I guess it's likely that it won't be). I guess a suspicious backup is better than no backup at all.

Now that I know that full support isn't there I'll unschedule my daily SuperDuper! run and wait for the update. Looks like Shirt Pocket wasn't too happy about Apple not letting their $500-a-year ADC Select members get their hands on the final version of Leopard until *after* the retail customers did; but Shirt Pocket is not alone in that sentiment.

Although it would have been nice if Apple had provided developers with the GM for final testing, at least they were a little quicker this time around than they were with Tiger. Download access came only a couple days after the retail release and a mail-borne copy came within the first two weeks.
