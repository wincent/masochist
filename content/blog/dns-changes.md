title: DNS changes

In preparation for some pretty big changes to the hosting arrangements for this site, today the nameservers ([DNS](/wiki/DNS)) for wincent.com were migrated away from a [INetU](/wiki/INetU) (the current webhost) to [Nettica](http://nettica.com). I'll be writing more about what these hosting changes will be on another occasion, but in the meantime I just wanted to post notice of the nameserver migration.

There have been no changes to the website itself and the [IP](/wiki/IP) addresses are all unchanged, so in theory everything should continue exactly as before. Nevertheless I wanted to ask that you let me know (via email to <win@wincent.com> or by opening a [ticket](/wiki/ticket)) if you see any unexpected behaviour or experience any problems connecting to the site.
