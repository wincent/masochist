title: Leopard product readiness
---

With [Leopard](http://www.wincent.com/knowledge-base/Leopard) only 15 hours from release it's time for a product status report:


### Leopard-ready

The following products have received extensive testing on pre-release versions of Leopard and are expected to work with a high degree of compatibility. When Apple ships the final version to developers further testing will be performed to see if any further changes are required:

-   [Synergy](http://synergy.wincent.com): the lightweight, robust, and feature-packed iTunes controller.
-   [Install](http://install.wincent.com): simple and dependable installation solution for developers.
-   [WOTest](http://test.wincent.com): open source Objective-C unit testing framework.
-   [Wincent Strings Utility](http://strings.wincent.com): open source localization helper tool for developers.


### Beta-status

This product hasn't been heavily tested with Leopard but conflicting reports have been received that it continues to work under the new operating system; others report that they've been unable to install it. When the Leopard final arrives further investigation will be undertaken.

-   [WinSwitch](http://winswitch.wincent.com/): Fast User Switching menu replacement.


### Coming soon

These products aren't yet Leopard-ready but work is well on the way to completion (about 90% done) and so I hope to release Leopard-compatible versions within the next two to three weeks:

-   [Synergy Advance](http://advance.wincent.com): Plug-in based audio companion.
-   [Hextrapolate](http://hextrapolate.wincent.com): Programmers number conversion tool.


### Unknown

The status of the following product on Leopard is unknown:

-   [atosym](http://atosym.wincent.com/): Address-to-symbol conversion aid for programmers.


### All other products

There are a number of other products which aren't specifically tied to the Mac OS X platform, and so should work on Leopard just as they did under Tiger:

-   [Bansshee](http://bansshee.wincent.com): protection against SSH dictionary attacks.
-   [Walrus](http://walrus.wincent.com): object-oriented templating system written in [Ruby](http://www.wincent.com/knowledge-base/Ruby).
