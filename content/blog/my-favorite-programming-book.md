My favorite programming text of all time is the [O'Reilly](http://oreilly.com/) [C Pocket Reference](http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/cpr) by Peter Prinz and Ulla Kirch-Prinz:

If only more books could be written like this. Small, compact, clear, comprehensive, it tells me everything I've ever needed to know about C. It costs a mere $9.95 and is worth every penny. Nowadays, in this age of online documentation, the [O'Reilly Pocket Reference Series](http://pocketrefs.oreilly.com/) is about the only printed material that I ever access with any frequency.
