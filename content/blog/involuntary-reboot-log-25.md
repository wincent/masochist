title: Involuntary Reboot Log #25
tags: blog
---

Like I said the other day, looks like [this iMac is dying](http://www.wincent.com/a/about/wincent/weblog/archives/2008/01/imac_finally_dy.php). This time the machine simply turned itself off when I bumped the desk with my knee; it could barely even be called a bump.

The average time between failures is dropping. Not long ago it was about one month, but now it's approaching three weeks, and if you look at the average over the last month the failures have been almost weekly.

Apart from the risk of damage to my data, I am starting to get sick of these Disk First Aid runs (during which the machine is unusable), which go especially slowly because [Spotlight](http://www.wincent.com/knowledge-base/Spotlight) decides to reindex *all* of my volumes every time I have one of these failures.

On a tangential note: I received an email in response to my [last post](http://www.wincent.com/a/about/wincent/weblog/archives/2008/01/imac_finally_dy.php) in which I complained about the lack of RAM in the low-end iMacs. It was pointed out to me that real-world RAM really is cheap nowadays (even if RAM from [Apple](http://www.wincent.com/knowledge-base/Apple) is not). You can max out an iMac to 4 GB for a mere $100 at [my retailer of choice](http://macsales.com) (OWC), and for someone like me living in Europe and buying the RAM from the US you're still looking at only 85€ *including* international shipping.
