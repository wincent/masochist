title: RailsConf and the Rails 3 alpha

It's not possible for me to attend conferences like [RailsConf](http://en.oreilly.com/rails2009/) so I tend not to pay much attention to them.

Imagine my surprise when I [read that](http://weblog.rubyonrails.org/2009/4/24/this-week-in-edge-rails) "the core team gets ready for a Rails 3.0 alpha release at RailsConf" and *then* find out that said conference is scheduled to start on 4 May 2009; that is, about a week from now!

Woah. "Rails 3" was supposed to be the merger of Merb and Rails. It was supposed to be just about the closest thing to a ground-up rewrite that you could expect. It is *nowhere near finished* and nowhere near delivering all the things that were promised yet. Why are they even talking about alphas? Why do they feel that they always, without fail, have to "make a splash"?

I personally would rather that they work patiently and methodically towards a Rails 3 that delivers on the great potential of the merge they [announced](http://rubyonrails.org/merb) only a few months ago (December 2008), instead of hacking together a rushed, buggy, incomplete mess. People build applications on top of this thing; they depend on their livelihood for it. Can't we have some responsibility please?
