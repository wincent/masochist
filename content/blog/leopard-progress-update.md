title: Leopard progress update
tags: blog

Although the latest version of [Synergy](http://synergy.wincent.com/) already runs quite well on all versions of [Mac OS X](http://www.wincent.com/knowledge-base/Mac%20OS%20X) from [Jaguar](http://www.wincent.com/knowledge-base/Jaguar) right up to (and including) [Leopard](http://www.wincent.com/knowledge-base/Leopard), I have been working on a rewrite in [Objective-C 2.0](http://www.wincent.com/knowledge-base/Objective-C%202.0) which will is specifically designed for Leopard. The first phase of migration (API updates and build process changes) is complete and the next phase (migration to Garbage Collection) is underway. I'm hoping to have an alpha version out soon, with a Leopard-targeted release of [Synergy Advance](http://advance.wincent.com/) following close behind.
