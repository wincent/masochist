title: Assigning keyboard shortcuts to user scripts in Xcode 3
---

You used to be able to do this prior to Xcode 3, but I can't see how to do this in the current release. Anyone know how? Without this feature the scripts menu becomes next to useless (for my usage patterns).


### Update

Roberto Cruz was phenomenally quick and contacted me only 10 minutes after I wrote the above post; you can assign shortcuts directly in the "Edit User Scripts..." window by double-clicking in the right-hand column in the script listing. Believe it or not I had actually looked for such a feature and failed to see it...
