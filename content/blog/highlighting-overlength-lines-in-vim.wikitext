title: Highlighting overlength lines in Vim
tags: vim
---
After defining a couple of colors in my [[Vim]] color scheme:

 hi LineProximity guibg=#DDDDB6
 hi LineOverflow guibg=#AAAAB6

And adding a couple lines to my `~/.vimrc`:

 let w:m1=matchadd('LineProximity', '\%<81v.\%>75v', -1)
 let w:m2=matchadd('LineOverflow', '\%>80v.\+', -1)

I now have some special highlighting that shows up when lines in my source code start getting near the 80-column limit (shown in light gray), and actually surpass it (shown in darker gray):

Not quite as pretty as a vertical line serving as a visual guide (like you'd see in [[Xcode]], [[TextMate]] or [[BBEdit]]), but it has the advantage that it will work nicely even if you have to reduce your window size and your text starts wrapping.

= Making the changes stick =

In reality those `let` lines in the config only apply to the first window that appears when you launch [[Vim]]. To make the settings "stick" for all windows you need to [http://vim.wikia.com/wiki/Detect_window_creation_with_WinEnter detect window creation] and apply the settings for each new window. This is done with the following snippet, as [http://vim.wikia.com/wiki/Detect_window_creation_with_WinEnter explained] on the Vim wiki:

<pre>autocmd VimEnter * autocmd WinEnter * let w:created=1
autocmd VimEnter * let w:created=1

autocmd WinEnter * if !exists('w:created') | let w:m1=matchadd('LineProximity', '\%<81v.\%>75v', -1) | endif
autocmd WinEnter * if !exists('w:created') | let w:m2=matchadd('LineOverflow', '\%>80v.\+', -1) | endif</pre>
