title: Apple's bugreporter

[Use it](http://bugreporter.apple.com/). It's one way in which we can all help Mac OS X to get better. I'm not the most disciplined of bug reporters to Apple because I don't like their interface, but I have been filing more bug reports lately. Read on for some stats.





#### Some interesting numbers

Since I filed my first bug report with Apple in December 2003 they have received 650,000 bug reports. Their system currently has over 4 million bug reports in all.

I spent approximately an hour filing six bug reports on 30 April 2005. In the roughly 55 to 60 minutes that it took me to file those reports another 33 bugs were filed by other people.

Of the 18 bug reports that I've filed 4 have been fixed and 14 are unresolved. It appears that at least one of the bugs I've filed are no longer shown on the page; in particular I recall one which ended up not being a bug at all but something that I misinterpreted in the documentation.
