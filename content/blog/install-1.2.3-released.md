I'm pleased to announce that [Install version 1.2.3](http://www.wincent.com/a/products/install/), a maintenance release, is now [available to licensees](http://www.wincent.com/a/products/install/download/). This release fixes a rare crash when deleting files with root privileges. Although the crash is rare (one crash report in 18 months), this is a recommended upgrade for all licensees. See the [full change history](http://www.wincent.com/a/products/install/history/) for more details.
