title: Xcode's Subversion support
tags: blog
---

I've been "using" Xcode's built-in [Subversion](http://subversion.tigris.org/) support for a long time now. Today I realized that lately I have been doing all my interaction with Subversion via the command line, even though I have the support turned on in Xcode. The reason? Xcode's support is flakey at best and although it gets less flakey with each Xcode update it is still a long way from being professional quality.

But still, it would be nice to have a GUI for quickly doing common operations. I'm sick of having to type long path names. It would be nice to be able to do stuff like moving/renaming via drag-and-drop. So I'm evaluating [SmartSVN](http://www.smartcvs.com/smartsvn/features.jsp) and thinking of switching to it. I may as well turn off Xcode's SVN support right now in any case; it will probably make it run faster.
