There's been a huge storm in a tea-cup lately over Matt Aimonetti's "[CouchDB: Perform like a pr0n star](http://www.slideshare.net/mattetti/couchdb-perform-like-a-pr0n-star)" presentation. It's been unexpectedly polemical. The responses have been exceptionally strong and polarized:

-   people who view the presentation as inappropriate or unprofessional and are extremely upset, offended or threatened
-   people who approve of Matt's presentation and vehemently defend his right to be as "edgy" as he pleases

But let's not forget the third category:

-   people in the "middle of the road" — who perhaps approve, disapprove, or don't care — but who regardless of their perspective don't get all vocal about it

I'm firmly in the third camp. I think the people who have invested their energies in writing 2,000 word essays on the subject really could have spent their time a lot more wisely.

My two line take on the issue:

> The presentation was evidently inappropriate, offensive, in bad taste, and he should have known better. But *big deal*; Matt's lack of good taste is hardly worth the amount of energy that has been poured into discussing it, *even if* he is a Rails "[Activist](http://rubyonrails.org/activists)".

"Professionalism" isn't a dirty word. It [isn't](http://twitter.com/dhh/status/1631100714) "façade, fake sincerity, political correctness, not offending anyone, and everything else that makes life lifeless". On the contrary it's just focussing on doing your job well; and if the task at hand happens to be making a technical presentation to a heterogenous audience then that means doing so with a modicum of respect, good taste, and an awareness of what kind of message is appropriate.

Matt made an error of judgement and I don't hold it against him; but if he doesn't learn his lesson and goes and does this kind of thing again then, well, I'll have to revise my evaluation.
