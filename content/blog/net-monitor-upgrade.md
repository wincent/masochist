title: Net Monitor upgrade
---

I just bought an upgrade license for [Net Monitor](http://homepage.mac.com/rominar/net.html), seeing as the old version (4.1.1) I'm running won't work when I [get my hands](http://www.wincent.com/a/about/wincent/weblog/archives/2007/10/on_the_internal.php) on [Leopard](http://www.wincent.com/knowledge-base/Leopard).

How long did I think about whether to make the purchase? About 2.3 seconds. Guy Meyer, the author, has one of the fairest upgrade policies you're ever likely to find. My initial purchase was back in January 2004. Now, nearly four years later in October 2007, Guy offers me a 50% upgrade discount on the already very reasonably-priced single user license (currently 7.38€ at today's exchange rates); after tax that makes the upgrade only 4.28€.

As a customer, I applaud Guy for his fair policy. I hope he's making enough sales to make it worthwhile for him.
