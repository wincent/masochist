Let me share with you my experience with Safari on Mac OS X.

Basically, it's a mature product which never crashes ''except'' when code deep down in the Flash plug-in screws up. I'd go so far as to say that more than 95% of the crashing bugs "in" Safari aren't actually in Safari itself at all, but in darn Flash.

So they're [http://www.appleinsider.com/articles/09/01/31/adobe_apple_working_together_on_flash_for_iphone.html working on bringing Flash to the iPhone]? Can't say that I'm too excited about that. I'd rather they didn't.
