This time the Finder was [beachballing](/wiki/beachballing) repeatedly while trying to drag a PDF via its "proxy icon" in the Preview title bar into an open Finder window corresponding to a volume mounted from a USB stick. When the beachballing became permanent I tried to force quit the Finder, but it refused to restart. I then tried to restart the machine and it proceeded to hang for 8 hours at a blue screen with a spinning "progress" indicator. I finally gave up and decided to do a [hard reset](/wiki/hard_reset).

I. Cannot. Wait. To. Replace. This. Machine.
