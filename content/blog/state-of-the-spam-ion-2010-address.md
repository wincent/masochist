title: State of the Spam-ion 2010 Address

The spam "problem" is getting worse. Since [my last report](/blog/state-of-the-spam-ion-2009-address) in April 2009 there has been a considerable growth in the volume of spam.

The good news is that the tools used to handle the problem (in particular, [SpamSieve](/wiki/SpamSieve)) are more than up to the task, so "quality of life" hasn't really been affected at all.

-   Spam now accounts for 58% of all mail I receive
-   [SpamSieve](/wiki/SpamSieve) maintained its accuracy of 99.8% correct, and the number of detected false positives since the last report (8 months) was a very respectable 5.
