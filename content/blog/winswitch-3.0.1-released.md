title: WinSwitch 3.0.1 released

[WinSwitch](http://www.wincent.com/a/products/winswitch/) version 3.0.1 is now available for download. This is a maintenance release that [includes localization updates and fixes](http://www.wincent.com/a/products/winswitch/history/).

WinSwitch is freeware but I depend on donations to cover the costs of distribution and development, so please consider [making a contribution](https://secure.wincent.com/a/products/winswitch/donate/). I have some wonderful ideas for improving WinSwitch, but I need your financial support to implement them. The total donation to download ratio is still less than 4 in 1000.

If you haven't used WinSwitch before [take a look at the screenshots](http://www.wincent.com/a/products/winswitch/screenshots/) or head over to the [downloads page](http://www.wincent.com/a/products/winswitch/download/) and take it for a spin!
