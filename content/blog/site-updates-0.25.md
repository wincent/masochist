Just deployed some updates to the site ([full change list here](/snippets/9)). Most of these changes are part of the integrated [Git](/wiki/Git) [repo browsing](/repos) functionality (nothing to see there yet as I haven't yet configured any repos, but most of the groundwork is now laid) but there are a couple of user-visible fixes and enhancements:

-   \[Fix\]: Restore missing submit button in new topic form
-   \[Enhancement\]: Use [CSS](/wiki/CSS) to highlight "active fragment" if URL includes a fragment (for example, when linking to [a comment](/comments/6341), the comment gets highlighted)
