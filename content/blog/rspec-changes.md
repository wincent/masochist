title: RSpec changes
tags: blog

I've been using [RSpec](http://rspec.rubyforge.org/) a fair bit this year and have been trying to make some contributions back to the community because it is such a wonderful project.

The thing is, despite its relative youth, RSpec is already a very refined project with some very smart people working on it. For the relative new-comer like me small bits and pieces are probably the order of the day.

I've started off with [some](http://rubyforge.org/pipermail/rspec-users/2007-May/001703.html) [tweaks](http://rubyforge.org/tracker/index.php?func=detail&aid=11253&group_id=797&atid=3151) to RSpec's interaction with `autotest`, [corrections](http://rubyforge.org/tracker/index.php?func=detail&aid=11252&group_id=797&atid=3151) to the shared behaviour functionality, and today I've made some [basic extensions](http://rubyforge.org/tracker/index.php?func=detail&aid=11254&group_id=797&atid=3151) to the RSpec TextMate bundle: some additional syntax colouring and displaying behaviours and examples in the function pop-up as shown below:
