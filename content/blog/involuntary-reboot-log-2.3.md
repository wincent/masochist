Same symptoms as the [earlier](/blog/involuntary-reboot-log-2.1) [entries](/blog/involuntary-reboot-log-2.2); that makes 3 [hard resets](/wiki/hard_resets) in 24 hours, so looks like I have a fairly serious problem.

-   Kernel panics: 0
-   Hard resets: 3
-   Total failures: 3
-   Start of recording keeping: 17 March 2010
-   Total days to date: 35 days
-   Average time between failures: 11.67 days
