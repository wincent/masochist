For the bold and adventurous, the new alpha preview of the next version of [Synergy](/wiki/Synergy) (5.0a) is now out. Synergy is a lightweight, highly-customizable [iTunes](/wiki/iTunes) controller.

This is a development release targeting (and requiring) [Mac OS X](/wiki/Mac_OS_X) 10.8 [Mountain Lion](/wiki/Mountain_Lion) and is 64-bit only (ie. it will only run on Macs capable of running 64-bit applications). The 4.0 stable series (currently at version 4.5.2) continues to be the recommended version for normal use, and is what you get by default if you hit [the download page](/products/synergy/download). On that same page you'll find legacy versions that can be used with older versions of the [operating system](/wiki/operating_system) right back to Mac OS X 10.2 [Jaguar](/wiki/Jaguar).

A full changelog appears [here](/products/synergy/history). The version number has been bumped to 5.0a to indicate that this release breaks compatibility with older versions of the [OS](/wiki/OS), and with 32-bit-only Macs. It includes some fairly radical changes to the internal plumbing and some aggressive cut-backs (eg. removing stale or incomplete localizations, removing the Growl support) in order to get onto the latest and greatest Apple technologies.

This will be a free upgrade for users with a valid license for Synergy 4.0 (which means any license purchased after 5 September 2006). See [this blog post](/blog/synergy-4.0-upgrades) to find out whether you qualify. If you got Synergy through the MacHeist Giving Tree bundle see [the MacHeist FAQ](/blog/frequently-asked-questions-about-synergy-and-macheist).
