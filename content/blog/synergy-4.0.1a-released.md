[Synergy](/wiki/Synergy), the lightweight, highly-customizable [iTunes](/wiki/iTunes) controller has been updated to version 4.0.1a, especially for [Mac OS X](/wiki/Mac_OS_X) 10.6 [Snow Leopard](/wiki/Snow_Leopard).

This is the latest release in the alpha/experimental series and represents the cutting-edge of development. It will *only* run on [Snow Leopard](/wiki/Snow_Leopard). (Version 3.4, the last release in the stable series will run on all versions of Mac OS X from 10.2.8 upwards.) A full changelog appears [here](/products/synergy/history).
