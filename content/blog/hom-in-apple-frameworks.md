title: HOM in Apple frameworks

Was quite surprised today when browsing the [articles](http://nifty-box.com/blog/2006/12/nsinvocation-cleans-code.html) [linked](http://toxicsoftware.com/blog/grab-that-invocation/) to (via [this article](http://nifty-box.com/blog/2006/12/worker-thread-nsinvocation-part-2.html)) from Scott Stevenson's new [Cocoa Blogs](http://cocoablogs.com/) site.

I've never used `NSUndoManager` and so I didn't realize that there's actually an example of trampoline-based [HOM](http://www.wincent.com/a/about/wincent/weblog/archives/hom/) in an Apple framework. I wonder if there are others.
