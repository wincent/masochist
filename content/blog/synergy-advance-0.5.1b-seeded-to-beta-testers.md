A new beta of [Synergy Advance](http://advance.wincent.com/), version 0.5.1b, has just been seeded to beta testers ([see the announcement](http://lists.wincent.com/pipermail/synergy-advance-beta/2007-May/000007.html) posted to the [Synergy Advance beta testers mailing list](http://lists.wincent.com/mailman/listinfo/synergy-advance-beta)) which includes the features whose development I've been talking about on [my personal weblog](http://colaiuta.net/) over the last few days. These include [new hot keys and a customizable Dock Menu](http://www.wincent.com/a/about/wincent/weblog/archives/2007/05/synergy_advance_3.php), plus the ability to set half-star ratings [from the Dock](http://www.wincent.com/a/about/wincent/weblog/archives/2007/05/halfstar_rating.php) and [Global Menus](http://www.wincent.com/a/about/wincent/weblog/archives/2007/05/halfstar_rating_1.php), in addition to bug fixes and other enhancements fully described in [the change log](http://www.wincent.com/a/products/synergy-advance/history/#0.5.1b).

There are still some minor issues to be fixed in the beta, but the software is quite usable in its current form. The latest official stable release, [0.4](http://www.wincent.com/a/products/synergy-advance/history/#0.4), continues to be available from [the downloads page](http://www.wincent.com/a/products/synergy-advance/download/).

Rather than doing a non-beta 0.5 release I decided to press on adding new features and jump straight to 0.5.1 beta. I'm still hoping to hit 1.0 by the time [Apple](http://www.wincent.com/knowledge-base/Apple) releases [Leopard](http://www.wincent.com/knowledge-base/Leopard) in October 2007.

If you'd like to try it out, please see the [downloads page](http://www.wincent.com/a/products/synergy-advance/download/). Licenses can be purchased [here](https://secure.wincent.com/a/products/synergy-advance/purchase/).
