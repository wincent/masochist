The [trick I previously described](http://www.wincent.com/a/about/wincent/weblog/archives/2006/08/darn_godaddy.php) for working around GoDaddy's galling [bait-and-switch scam](http://www.wincent.com/a/about/wincent/weblog/archives/2006/07/godaddy_scam.php) on private registrations no longer works. I tried to remove privacy on an expiring domain and then renew it, adding private registration, and GoDaddy's interface allows me to specify privacy in the lead-up to the checkout but on getting there there is no privacy in my cart and no apparent way to add it.

#### Updated workaround

1.  [Search Google](http://www.google.com/search?q=godaddy+%22promo+code%22&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8) for 'godaddy "promo code"'.
2.  Remove privacy on the domain to be renewed.
3.  Renew it using a promo code. Today I was able to get a 10% discount by entering `HASH3` (found [here](http://www.hostingadvices.com/godaddy-cheap-domain.php)); so that's a one-year dot-com renewal for US$7.20, including the ICANN fee.
4.  After renewal is complete, add privacy again as a separate transaction; this will work. Again, try to find the best promo code you can; today I got 10% off using `SAVENOW` (found on [the same page](http://www.hostingadvices.com/godaddy-cheap-domain.php)), yielding private registration for US$4.49, all inclusive.

#### Drawbacks

-   The total renewal price with privacy is [still too high](http://www.wincent.com/a/about/wincent/weblog/archives/2006/05/godaddys_renewa.php) (US$11.69) but still better than the ridiculous US$18.19 that GoDaddy wanted to charge.
-   The workaround requires you to perform two transactions instead of one.
-   Given that the workaround involves two separate transactions, your personal information is exposed in the public WHOIS database for a longer period of time; still only a number of minutes, but annoying nonetheless. An additional annoyance was that during the period of vulnerability GoDaddy/Domains by Proxy provided an out-of-date email address in the WHOIS registry (a real account, not a spam honey-pot address); I have no idea why they published this information, seeing as I updated that email address with both GoDaddy/Domans by Proxy long ago.
