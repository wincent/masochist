title: Synergy Advance 0.4 beta 4

I've just put a new build of the Synergy Advance version 0.4 beta on the server (0.4 beta 4) to correct a spurious crash warning that may appear on first launch. If you've already installed 0.4 beta 3 then there is no need to upgrade; the spurious warning appears only once.

See the [previous release announcement](http://www.wincent.com/a/news/archives/2006/04/synergy_advance_6.php) for full details.
