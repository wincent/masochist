After months of testing without skipping a beat I am proud to announce the public release of [Bansshee](http://bansshee.org/), a lightweight daemon written in Perl designed to thwart dictionary-based brute force SSH attacks.

It's been running non-stop on this server since it was deployed in April 2006 and in that time has blocked many thousands of attack attempts. Bansshee is free software [released](http://www.wincent.com/a/products/bansshee/#download) under the GPL. [Donations](http://www.wincent.com/a/products/bansshee/#donations) are welcome.
