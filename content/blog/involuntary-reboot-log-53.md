title: Involuntary Reboot Log #53
tags: involuntary.reboot.log blog

Is this a new record? It's been over two months since [the last](/blog/involuntary-reboot-log-52) [involuntary reboot](/wiki/involuntary_reboot). This time it was the flakey hardware again; a bump to the desk was enough to prompt sparks and a power cut in the wonky power socket.

This is the now the second time in a while that my "average time between failures" has actually gone *up* rather than down.

-   Kernel panics: 26
-   Hard resets: 27
-   Total failures: 53
-   Start of recording keeping: 21 May 2006
-   Total days to date: 1113 days
-   Average time between failures: 21.0 days
