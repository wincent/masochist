title: WinSwitch 3.2b Universal Binary release

[WinSwitch](http://www.wincent.com/a/products/winswitch/) version 3.2b (beta) is now available for download. This is a beta release which offers native compatibility with both PowerPC and Intel processors ("Universal Binary"). In addition to the Universal Binary status this release brings a number of bugfixes as described in [the full change history](http://www.wincent.com/a/products/winswitch/history/).

This is use-at-your-own risk beta software that is likely to have bugs. The previous stable release (version 3.1) is [still available](http://www.wincent.com/a/products/winswitch/download/) for download on the downloads page.

WinSwitch is freeware but I depend on donations to cover the costs of distribution and development, so please consider [making a contribution](https://secure.wincent.com/a/products/winswitch/donate/). The download-to-donation ratio is well over 1,000 to 1, so please think about helping out.

If you haven't used WinSwitch before [take a look at the screenshots](http://www.wincent.com/a/products/winswitch/screenshots/) or head over to the [downloads page](http://www.wincent.com/a/products/winswitch/download/) and take it for a spin!
