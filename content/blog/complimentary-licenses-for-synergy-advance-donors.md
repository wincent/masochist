Now that the first public preview release of Synergy Advance is drawing near Wincent has sent out complimentary license codes to those people who kindly made a donation during the development cycle. These license codes were sent to the email address used to make the donation. If you made a donation and did not receive a license notice please [contact Wincent](http://www.wincent.com/a/contact/mail/) and include the date on which you made the donation, the amount and your full name.
