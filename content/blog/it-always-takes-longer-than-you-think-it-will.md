Looking back over some old posts I wrote I found [this one](http://wincent.com/a/about/wincent/weblog/archives/2006/10/objectoriented.php), dated 8 January 2007:

> Doing a ground-up rewrite of [Cheetah](/wiki/Cheetah) in [Ruby](/wiki/Ruby) would be a daunting task and far beyond me. But writing something which does only the basic operations I want, nothing more, and addresses the problems I have with Cheetah, *could probably be done in a few days*. This has a much narrower scope than Cheetah, it is only really intended for compiling and filing static templates (to produce help documentation).

Then follows a chain of status updates ([1](http://wincent.com/a/about/wincent/weblog/archives/2007/01/progress_notes.php), [2](http://wincent.com/a/about/wincent/weblog/archives/2007/01/writing_a_parse.php), [3](http://wincent.com/a/about/wincent/weblog/archives/2007/02/abstract_syntax.php), [4](http://wincent.com/a/about/wincent/weblog/archives/2007/02/putting_the_pac.php), [5](http://wincent.com/a/about/wincent/weblog/archives/2007/02/updated_packrat.php), [6](http://wincent.com/a/about/wincent/weblog/archives/2007/02/parser_generato.php), [7](http://wincent.com/a/about/wincent/weblog/archives/2007/02/another_perform.php), [8](http://wincent.com/a/about/wincent/weblog/archives/2007/02/here_documents.php) and [9](http://wincent.com/a/about/wincent/weblog/archives/2007/02/goodbye_parity.php)) and about 187 revisions ([Subversion](/wiki/Subversion) commits) later, on 12 April 2007 I [finally wrote](http://wincent.com/a/about/wincent/weblog/archives/2007/04/payoff_time.php):

> It turns out that what started out as a simple project ended up becoming quite a bit more complex.

Isn't that always the way?
