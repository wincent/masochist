title: Movable Type 4.0.1
---

This is my first post from my new [Movable Type](http://www.wincent.com/knowledge-base/Movable%20Type) install after the upgrade from the old version 3.35 to the new 4.0.1. I really couldn't be more impressed with the ease of the upgrade process; easily the best I've ever seen in a large web application. My only doubt was over my custom [wikitext](http://www.wincent.com/knowledge-base/wikitext) plug-in that I use to format a lot of the entries, but it seems that it works without any modifications on the new 4.0 series.

Looking forward to trying this thing out. The interface looks slick as hell, the stats are a nice frill and the live preview is an instant win. I've always preferred the MT [UI](http://www.wincent.com/knowledge-base/UI) over the [WordPress](http://www.wincent.com/knowledge-base/WordPress) one although I know that this was just a question of personal taste; but with this release I think the gap has widened and WP is now trailing behind by a significant margin, objectively.

My upgrade notes can be found on the "[Upgrading from Movable Type version 3.35 to 4.0.1](http://www.wincent.com/knowledge-base/Upgrading%20from%20Movable%20Type%20version%203.35%20to%204.0.1)" page, but the truth is there was so little work actually required that there's not much to say about it. Hats off to Six Apart. They've well and truly redeemed themselves.
