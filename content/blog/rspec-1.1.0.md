title: RSpec 1.1.0
---

The [release notes](http://rubyforge.org/frs/shownotes.php?release_id=17107) belie the scope of the changes in this [RSpec](http://www.wincent.com/knowledge-base/RSpec) release. It's been a long time, and this is a *huge* release with, for me, three big things:

-   the "Story Runner"
-   nested example groups
-   total and seamless interoperability with Test::Unit

David Chelimsky's [announcement posted to the mailing list](http://rubyforge.org/pipermail/rspec-users/2007-December/005009.html) gives a much clearer idea of the scope of the changes.

Programming in [Ruby](http://www.wincent.com/knowledge-base/Ruby) is fun but the truth is I like *programming* in [Objective-C](http://www.wincent.com/knowledge-base/Objective-C) more (especially now that we're talking about Objective-C 2.0). But I like *testing* with Ruby and RSpec more. I wish this kind of thing were possible in Objective-C, but I fear that the joys of [autotest](http://www.wincent.com/knowledge-base/autotest) will never be available in a compiled language. You can fake it and come close with some kind of [continuous integration](http://www.wincent.com/knowledge-base/continuous%20integration) tests running in the background, but no matter how much you optimize it you're never going to have the instant feedback that you get with Ruby/RSpec/autotest.
