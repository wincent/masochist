title: Temporary outage
tags: blog

The site was offline briefly last night due to [power supply issues in the datacenter](http://www.rackspace.com/information/announcements/datacenter.php); generator power kicked in fine, but on switching back to the normal supply the cooling systems didn't come back online and as a result my hosting provider had to proactively shut down some servers to prevent them from overheating. A very surprising slip-up from [Rackspace](http://service.bfast.com/bfast/click?bfmid=30735717&siteid=41506187&bfpage=hosting_headaches), widely considered to be the very best in the industry. Slashdot has [coverage of the incident](http://hardware.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=07/11/13/164253).

If you sent me email in the last few hours there is a small chance that I might not have received it. If you're expecting a reply from me but haven't received one please get in touch with me (<win@wincent.com>).
