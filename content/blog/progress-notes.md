Activity on the [Subversion log](http://www.wincent.com/a/about/wincent/weblog/svn-log/archives/) has been quiet lately because I've been working on documentation. In many ways the most mind-numbingly, excruciatingly boring and unrewarding work imaginable. But the truth is I am actually quite enjoying it because as part of this I have been working on some Object-Oriented templating stuff (as mentioned [here](http://www.wincent.com/a/about/wincent/weblog/archives/2007/01/testdriven_deve.php)) and this has required me to learn more about Ruby, test-driven development, behaviour-driven development, and even parser generators. More on this in a future post but for now just wanted to advise that I've had some important insights and will be writing about them shortly.
