According to [this journalist](http://news.cnet.com/8301-1001_3-10226746-92.html), Ubuntu is about to knock [Mac OS X](/wiki/Mac_OS_X) and Windows out of the game. Apparently, the new version of the operating system features windows that move "without jerkiness", apps which launch "fast", and a [UI](/wiki/UI) which has everything "where it should be". High praise indeed. Although one wonders what Ubuntu used to be like *before* this version. (In my personal experience, the windows on my [OS](/wiki/OS) have been moving "without jerkiness" for close to a decade now.)

> You won't be able to notice the vast improvement in Ubuntu's desktop experience over the past six months by browsing screenshot galleries of 9.04 or looking at new feature lists. What I'm talking about is that elusive slick-and-speedy feel you get from applications launching fast, windows moving around without jerkiness, and everything simply being where it should be in the user interface.

If this is the highest praise that can be heaped on the OS then it seems dead obvious that it's no real threat to either Windows or Mac OS X.
