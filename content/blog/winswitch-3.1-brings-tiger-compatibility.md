[WinSwitch](http://www.wincent.com/a/products/winswitch/) version 3.1 is now available for download. This is a maintenance release that delivers compatibility with Tiger and [includes localization updates and fixes](http://www.wincent.com/a/products/winswitch/history/).

WinSwitch is freeware but I depend on donations to cover the costs of distribution and development, so please consider [making a contribution](https://secure.wincent.com/a/products/winswitch/donate/).

If you haven't used WinSwitch before [take a look at the screenshots](http://www.wincent.com/a/products/winswitch/screenshots/) or head over to the [downloads page](http://www.wincent.com/a/products/winswitch/download/) and take it for a spin!
