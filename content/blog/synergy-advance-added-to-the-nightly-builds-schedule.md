title: Synergy Advance added to the nightly builds schedule

Last month I began trialing the new [nightly builds system](http://www.wincent.com/a/news/archives/2007/03/nightly_builds.php) with [nightlies](http://www.wincent.com/a/about/wincent/weblog/nightlog/archives/synergy/) for [Synergy](http://synergy.wincent.com/). This is because I want to move towards a more [open development process](http://www.wincent.com/a/about/wincent/weblog/archives/2007/03/planned_changes.php).

Today [Synergy Advance](http://advance.wincent.com/) has been added to the nightly builds schedule.

These builds are for the curious who wish to get a sneak peak at work in progress towards the next version. The current official release (0.4) is still the one that is recommended for daily use and is available from the [downloads page](http://www.wincent.com/a/products/synergy-advance/download/).

The usual disclaimers apply to the nightly builds:

> Nightly builds are generated once per day by an automated system; they are not official releases and they receive no human testing prior to being uploaded. They are provided with no warranty of any kind; use them at your own risk.

I would describe the current Synergy Advance nightly ([Subversion](http://www.wincent.com/knowledge-base/Subversion) revision 429) as being alpha-quality. There are many rough edges, known issues, and things that plain just don't work yet. If you keep your eye on the [Nightlog RSS feed](http://www.wincent.com/a/about/wincent/weblog/nightlog/atom.xml) and the [Subversion commits feed](http://www.wincent.com/a/news/archives/2007/03/wincent.com/a/about/wincent/weblog/svn-log/atom.xml) you'll see that things very rapidly move towards beta-level and then final release before the end of this month (April 2007).
