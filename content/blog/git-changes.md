I've started adding more [Git](http://www.wincent.com/knowledge-base/Git) content to the [wiki](http://www.wincent.com/knowledge-base/wiki), and the more I explore, the more impressed I am.

Meanwhile, using Git becomes [more and more palatable](http://repo.or.cz/w/git.git?a=commit;h=36e5e70e0f40cf7ca4351b8159d68f8560a2805f).

My sense of aesthetics makes me feel queasy about typing commands like these:

    git-tag -l
    git-commit

But I am quite happy to type:

    git tag -l
    git commit
