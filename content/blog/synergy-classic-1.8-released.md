You may have noticed that in this announcement that I refer to it as "Synergy Classic" instead of just "Synergy". Back in November 2004 when I did the site redesign I started to change a lot of the Synergy references on the site to "Synergy Classic". This was to prepare the way for [Synergy Advance](http://www.wincent.com/a/products/synergy-advance/) and to help maintain a clear distinction between the two products. Now, with Synergy Advance just around the corner (2 May 2005 release) I'm going to start using the term "Synergy Classic" a lot more rigorously.
