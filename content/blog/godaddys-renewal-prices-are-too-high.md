title: GoDaddy's renewal prices are too high
tags: blog

This is some feedback I just sent to [GoDaddy](http://www.godaddy.com/), on the day on which the registration for piratewatch.org expires. I was going to renew it, but I decided that caving into GoDaddy's pricing model would only serve to reinforce what I view as their inacceptable practice. In this case I'm voting with my wallet.

> I think your private registrations are far too expensive. To add private registration only costs $1.95 (fair) but to renew it costs a whopping $8.95 which just seems like a rip off.

> I currently have 31 domains registered with GoDaddy. But due to the excessive cost of renewing them with private registration I am just going to have to let the dispensable ones expire...

> GoDaddy's pricing policy is going to end up hurting it. You have great prices for new customers, but you don't reward them for their loyalty; instead you give them a large disincentive to renew.

This is a shame. [I like GoDaddy](http://www.wincent.com/a/about/wincent/weblog/archives/2005/05/godaddy_vs_netw.php). But they've disappointed me in this case.

If someone else wants to snap up the domain I will be happy to continue hosting it on this server. At some point DNS look-ups for piratewatch.org will start to fail (when GoDaddy pulls the plug). In the meantime I have moved the site to [piratewatch.wincent.com](http://piratewatch.wincent.com/).

**Update June 2006:** I notice someone else has snapped up the domain.
