title: Welcome fixes in Mac OS X 10.3.6 update
tags: blog

It was with some pleasure that I noted the following in the release notes for Mac OS X 10.3.6:

-   Resolves an issue in which the display could sometimes remain dark when waking from display sleep (the mouse pointer might appear, but normal function could not be restored) if using Screen Saver password on a portable computer.
-   Safari no longer times out after 60 seconds when attempting to connect to a webpage or to submit form data. With this update, Safari will keep trying indefinitely (or until you cancel the attempt).

I've been bitten by the first issue on multiple occasions, so it's great to hear that it's been fixed. And the second issue has had me wasting countless mouse-clicks dismissing warning sheets in Safari thanks to my flakey Internet connection. And note that it's not just extending the time-out interval; it's actually retrying for you. Attention to details like this is what makes Mac OS X such a pleasure to use.
