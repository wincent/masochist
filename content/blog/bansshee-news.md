[Bansshee](http://bansshee.wincent.com/) is a free, open-source shield against brute-force SSH dictionary attacks. The Bansshee domain names are due to expire in a month so I am looking for donations from the community to cover the renewal fees. Please see [this article](http://www.wincent.com/a/about/wincent/weblog/archives/2007/03/a_call_for_help.php) for more details.

#### Update: 16 March 2007

Charles Steinman has kindly donated to cover the registrations for all three domains (dot-org, dot-com and dot-net).
