tags: blog

A conflict has been discovered between Mac OS X 10.2, [Synergy](http://www.wincent.com/a/products/synergy-classic/), and [Growl](http://growl.info/) which prevents version 1.7 from running on those systems (regardless of whether Growl is installed). A solution is currently under investigation and a fix (1.7.1) will be released on Monday at the latest. See [this report](http://www.wincent.com/a/support/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=123) for more information. Sorry about the inconvenience.
