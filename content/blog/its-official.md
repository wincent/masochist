And I want [one](http://www.apple.com/macpro/). Four times as many cores as my current iMac, and each core nearly twice as fast; it wouldn't surprise me if the thing was eight times faster in all. Would be nice to get those [17 minute builds](http://www.wincent.com/a/about/wincent/weblog/archives/2007/04/the_first_syner.php) down to 2 minutes!

#### Update

The [Spanish version](http://www.apple.com/es/) of the text reads, "Potencia nuclear: estación de trabajo Xeon de óctuple núcleo" (literally, "Nuclear power: station of work Xeon of octuple nuclei")... Hehe... sounds pretty cool in Spanish, doesn't it?
