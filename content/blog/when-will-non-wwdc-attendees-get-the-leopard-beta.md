title: When will non-WWDC-attendees get the Leopard beta?

So Apple has now [officially announced](http://developer.apple.com/wwdc/) that:

> At the Apple Worldwide Developers Conference, we're planning to show you a feature-complete version of Mac OS X Leopard, and you can take home a beta copy.

I'm wondering how long paying ADC members, like me, who aren't able to attend WWDC will have to wait before getting their hands on a copy. I personally couldn't care less about whether its feature complete or not; I just want a seed that is stable enough to do actual development work on.

I know that in part Apple artificially restricts distribution of the beta in order to attract developers to the conference, but I really don't like being left out in the cold when going to the conference is literally out of my hands. Conference numbers aren't really the important thing as I'm concerned. In the meantime, they probably need to rename their $500+ "[Leopard Early Start Kit](http://developer.apple.com/leopard/index.html)" to something not containing the word "early"...
