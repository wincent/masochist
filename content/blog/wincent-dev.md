title: Moving to wincent.dev

Please update any bookmarks you may have for `wincent.com` to point at `wincent.dev` instead.

If you cloned a Git repository from `git.wincent.com`, you should update the remote URL to use `git.wincent.dev` or GitHub instead. For example, if you cloned [Command-T](https://github.com/wincent/command-t) from `git.wincent.com`, you would use a command like one of the following:

```
# To set the "origin" remote's URL to git.wincent.dev:
git remote set-url origin git.wincent.dev:public/command-t.git

# To set the "origin" remote's URL to GitHub:
git remote set-url origin git@github.com:wincent/command-t.git
```
