title: New licensing for Install
tags: blog
---

I'm very pleased to announce a new licensing option for [Install](http://www.wincent.com/a/products/install/), made available exclusively for use with freeware and open-source projects that have an approved license (such as GPL or BSD). Developers will now be able to purchase a license for a low 29.95€, a considerable discount from the normal price which applies to commercial and shareware deployment (199€).

The new license is a binary-only license and offers all of the benefits and features of the [existing binary licenses](http://www.wincent.com/a/products/install/licensing/), but it may only be used to distribute freeware or open-source software that has an approved license. For more information see the [Install product pages](http://www.wincent.com/a/products/install/).
