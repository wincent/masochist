title: Synergy Advance 0.5b seeded to beta testers
tags: blog

If you've been monitoring the [nightly builds](http://www.wincent.com/s/nightlies/) then you'll know that [Synergy Advance](http://advance.wincent.com/) 0.5 has been nearing completion.

There is now little work left to be done before 0.5 is declared final, so today the first official beta release was seeded to testers (see [the post](http://lists.wincent.com/pipermail/synergy-advance-beta/2007-April/000006.html) to the [beta testers mailing list](http://lists.wincent.com/mailman/listinfo/synergy-advance-beta)). There are still some minor issues to be fixed during the beta period, but the software is quite usable in its current form.

The 31 bullet points in the [full change list](http://www.wincent.com/a/products/synergy-advance/history/) belie the huge amount of under-the-hood changes that have taken place since the last release. This is basically a total rewrite; painful but necessary to allow for future growth.

I am hoping that most of the major architectural overhauls are complete so I should be able to add features quite quickly from here on. The current plan is to hit 1.0 by the time [Apple](http://www.wincent.com/knowledge-base/Apple) releases [Leopard](http://www.wincent.com/knowledge-base/Leopard) in October 2007.

If you'd like to try it out, please see the [downloads page](http://www.wincent.com/a/products/synergy-advance/download/). The previous, stable release (version 0.4) will continue to be available from there. Licenses can be purchased [here](https://secure.wincent.com/a/products/synergy-advance/purchase/).
