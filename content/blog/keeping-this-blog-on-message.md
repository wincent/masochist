title: Keeping this blog "on message"
tags: blog
---

Lately I think I've been misusing this blog for the wrong kind of posts. I think I've been posting far too many pieces with the "[rant](/tags/rant)" tag on them, and even the posts without that tag are often just for the purposes of venting frustration at the little problems I've been encountering during development.

I don't really think this site should even *have* a "rant" tag at all. The blog is supposed to about development: and that means the *technical* aspects of how my products are developed, and also announcements about the status and releases of those products. I'm hereby resolving to stay focussed and not let my frustrations, irritations, and emotional state leak into the content and subject choices of my posts.

My recent [post on professionalism](/blog/on-professionalism) (from just a few minutes ago) will hopefully be the last one that's not really "on message". From now on I hope to keep "off-topic" stuff restricted to the "tweets" sidebar and nowhere else. Please let me know if you catch me slipping...
