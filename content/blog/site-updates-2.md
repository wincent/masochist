I just deployed a fairly big update to the site, the first one in about six months. Lots of things changed at all levels of the app (Rails 4.0, the beginnings of a responsive design etc).

I'm aware of some busted styles, but if you notice anything substantially wrong, [drop me a line](mailto:win@wincent.com){.mailto} and let me know.
