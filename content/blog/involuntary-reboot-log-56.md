Upstream network connectivity failure caused applications to flake out one by one, eventually resulting in some kind of resource exhaustion (any attempt to interact with any application which might cause a file access would cause the application to freeze permanently). After waiting nearly 15 minutes decided to proceed with the [hard reset](/wiki/hard_reset). Unfortunately lost a number of different work items in progress.

-   Kernel panics: 27
-   Hard resets: 29
-   Total failures: 56
-   Start of recording keeping: 21 May 2006
-   Total days to date: 1232 days
-   Average time between failures: 22.0 days
