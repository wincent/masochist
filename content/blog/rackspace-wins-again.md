[Rackspace](http://service.bfast.com/bfast/click?bfmid=30735717&siteid=41506187&bfpage=hosting_headaches) again ranks as [most reliable hosting company](http://news.netcraft.com/archives/2007/05/09/rackspace_easynet_and_easyspace_most_reliable_hosting_companies_in_april_2007.html) this month.

> The three leaders each had a perfect month, with no downtime and no failed requests for their corporate sites during an entire month of monitoring from eight locations around the globe. Rackspace continues to build upon its stellar uptime performance, having finished at the top of the survey six times in 2006. On April 30 the San Antonio-based managed hosting provider reported record 2006 revenues of $224 million, a 61 percent improvement over 2005. Rackspace said it added more than 3,000 new customers in 2006.

Their profitability isn't surprising; they charge premium prices and deliver best-of-class service in return.
