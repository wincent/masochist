title: Holiday Season 2005: Free Synergy licenses promotion
tags: blog
---

To celebrate the holiday season I've just launched a new promotion where you can get a free [Synergy](http://www.wincent.com/a/products/synergy-classic/) license when you [purchase](https://secure.wincent.com/a/products/synergy-advance/purchase/) a [Synergy Advance](http://www.wincent.com/a/products/synergy-advance/) license. See [this page](http://www.wincent.com/a/news/archives/2005/12/special_offer_b.php) for more info.

This should bring more people on board testing the preview releases of Synergy Advance, get Synergy into the hands of more people, and hopefully help fund further development.
