title: New site section: snippets
tags: site blog
---

For a while now I've wanted to add a section to the site for publishing short snippets of text (see [ticket \#1436](/issues/1436)). This is for things that are:

-   too long for a [tweet](/twitter)
-   not "on-topic" enough for a [blog post](/blog)
-   too transitory or ephemeral for a [wiki article](/wiki) (eg. things of only transitory importance, like notes about something I'm working on)

So, we're talking here about something like the "pasties" you can post at <http://pastie.org/>, or the "gists" of <http://gist.github.com/>, but hosted here so that I get the usual benefits of integration with the rest of the site (easy searchability, linkability, taggability, commentability etc).

I finally got around to adding this and I'm calling them, logically, "snippets". My first publication in snippet form is [this list of changes](/snippets/1) included in the just-deployed update. Consistent with the other parts of the site, it's got syntax highlighting, tags, commenting, and there are [Atom](/wiki/Atom) feeds that you can subscribe to to keep up-to-date:

-   <https://wincent.com/snippets.atom> summarizes the latest snippets;
-   and per-snippet feeds — like the one at <https://wincent.com/snippets/1.atom> — allow you to track when new comments are added to any given snippet

So from here on I should be able to keep the [blog](/blog) much more focussed on "real news" and less cluttered with transitory notes and such.

As this is a new feature please let me know via the [issue tracker](/wiki/issue_tracker) or email to <win@wincent.com> if you spot any glitches.
