I am spending a lot of hours staring at Xcode editor windows lately and I don't know if it's because I'm getting old, but it's getting harder and harder to look at the screen without feeling a minor sensation of irritation in the eyes.

Yesterday I decided to change the background color of my windows to a soft yellow, like I did with my Terminal windows long ago:

![](/system/images/legacy/yellow.png)

Turns out that the contrast of black text on yellow background is much sharper and more agreeable to the human eye than that of black text on pure white, which tends to be much harsher and more irritating. Works for me, at least.
