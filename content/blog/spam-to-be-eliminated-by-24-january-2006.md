Some good news at last: [according to Bill Gates](http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2004/01/24/tech/main595595.shtml) all spam will be eliminated from the world in just under two weeks from now. This is what he said on 24 January 2004:

> Two years from now, spam will be solved.

Can't wait for 24 January... In 2005 roughly 11% of all mail I received was spam (over 15,000 spam messages). If Bill turns out to be right then that number should drop away to zero, more or less. Has Bill ever been wrong before?
