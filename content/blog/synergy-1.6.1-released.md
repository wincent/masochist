title: Synergy 1.6.1 released
tags: blog

I've just put an update to [Synergy](http://www.wincent.com/a/products/synergy-classic/), version 1.6.1, on the mirror servers. This is identical in all respects to the 1.6 release which went out this morning, but it corrects a display error in the Synergy Preferences. (Specifically, in the "About" tab the registration status was not correctly displayed.)

This is a cosmetic issue only, so there is no need to upgrade to 1.6.1 if you have upgraded to 1.6 already. I just wanted to put this amended build out quickly though, to avoid potential confusion for registered users who haven't yet upgraded, and might mistakenly think that they have to re-enter their license codes.

Download it [here](http://www.wincent.com/download.php?item=Synergy.dmg) (1MB), [purchase](https://secure.wincent.com/a/products/synergy-classic/purchase/) or [donate](https://secure.wincent.com/a/products/synergy-classic/donate/) here, and [retrieve your lost license codes here](https://secure.wincent.com/a/support/registration/).
