I must be getting old. After years of using un-anti-aliased Monaco 10 for all coding, I'm finding that I have to lean forward uncomfortably to read it properly across the entire screen (and this is probably the densest display I've ever had at 2560 by 1440 pixels). I've decided to give Consolas a try at a relatively huge size (17) and with anti-aliasing turned on. Let today be a day free of peering! A nice comparison of programming fonts can be found [here](http://hivelogic.com/articles/top-10-programming-fonts).
