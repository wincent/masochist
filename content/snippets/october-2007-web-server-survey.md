The [vexing trend](http://news.netcraft.com/archives/2007/10/11/october_2007_web_server_survey.html) continues; Microsoft IIS gaining month after month at the expense of Apache. Why is an inferior, more expensive product gaining market share like that? (Can it be that *all* of the gains are from hosting companies like GoDaddy being bribed by MS to park domains on IIS?)
