The change I am most looking forward to in [Git](/wiki/Git) 1.7.0: "`git status` will not be `git commit --dry-run`. This change does not affect you if you run the command without pathspec. Nobody sane found the current behaviour of `git status Makefile` useful nor meaningful, and it confused users."
