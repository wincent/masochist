The problems that Bundler is trying to solve are a frickin' nightmare. Much harder, I think, than the problems that Rails itself has to solve. This is probably why I've filed so many bug reports against Bundler this last month or so. Every bug that gets squished, another three spring up in its place. Thank goodness it has a good test suite to catch regressions.
