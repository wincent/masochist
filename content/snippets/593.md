Interarchy 10 [is out](http://nolobe.com/interarchy/) and boasts "iFTP" as one of its major new features. Apparently this will allow us to "ditch tired old protocols like FTP, WebDAV and SFTP" and "\[t\]ake your file transfers to the next level". The only other reference I can find to it describes it as "Interarchy's own file transfer protocol built on top of SSH". Funnily enough, I found existing protocols like SFTP to be just fine.
