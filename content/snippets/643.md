I'm soon going to be deploying built-in [Git](/wiki/Git) repo browsing, which will eventually replace the separate [GitWeb](/wiki/GitWeb) installation currently hosted at <http://git.wincent.com/>. For now it's just a simple history viewer which permits you to see a list of repos, and see commits (and diffs) on the master branch. More to follow.
