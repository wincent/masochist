Way back in January 2006 I [posted](http://www.wincent.com/a/about/wincent/weblog/archives/2006/01/my_favorite_pro.php) a photo of my favorite programming book. Yesterday this battered old manual was given a second life in the form of spiral binding. Now the pages are no longer in danger of falling out, and it can [sit flat on the desktop](/system/images/spiral-bound-c-pocket-reference.jpg) (3072x2304 JPEG, 3.5MB).
