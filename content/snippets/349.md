Bad luck to all the people that actually trusted proprietary/for-profit [GitHub](/wiki/GitHub) to serve as a reliable, permanent [gem](/wiki/gem)-distribution mechanism. They [decided they weren't interested in continuing](http://github.com/blog/515-gem-building-is-defunct). My own gems continue to be hosted on [RubyForge](http://rubyforge.org), where they belong.
