Just spent an hour banging my head up against [mod\_rewrite](http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.0/mod/mod_rewrite.html) (trying to get multiple rewrite rules defined at various levels of specificity — in overlapping `VirtualHost`, `Directory`, `Location` scopes — to play nicely with each other). I emerge from the battle victorious but with a headache. And hating mod\_rewrite.
