title: Refactoring for table header cell drawing (REnamer, 9729ba7)
tags: snippets

This is just a pure refactoring with no behavioural changes for better readability and maintainability. In theory this could be refactored even further by splitting some of the functionality into a table column subclass, or perhaps into an NSTableColumn category.
