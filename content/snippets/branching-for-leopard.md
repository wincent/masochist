Given how [pleased I am with the Leopard API changes](http://www.wincent.com/a/about/wincent/weblog/archives/2006/09/leopard_api_cha.php), [created a new branch](http://www.wincent.com/knowledge-base/Creating_branches_with_Subversion) of [Synergy](http://synergy.wincent.com/) and [Synergy Advance](http://synergyadvance.com/) so that I can start implementing Leopard-only features on the trunk.
