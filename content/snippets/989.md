Somehow I missed this, but Puppet Labs [got $30m in funding](https://puppetlabs.com/blog/vmware-invests-30-million-in-puppet-labs/) in January this year. This is in the same park at the $19.5m investment that Opscode (Chef) [announced last year](http://www.opscode.com/blog/2012/03/26/opscode-announces-1950000-funding-hiring-community-growth-and-chefconf/). These are large votes of confidence in both of the top two configuration automation solutions. The debate on which one is best continues.
