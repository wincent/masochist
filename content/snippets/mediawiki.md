Another [MediaWiki](http://www.mediawiki.org/) upgrade (1.5.7). Would be nice if the author provided more information about the changes other than just, "This version includes fixes for compatibility with Internet Explorer 7 beta 2, and various other bugs; see the full changelog at the end of the release notes" (the "full" changelog provides even less information than the summary sentence!).
