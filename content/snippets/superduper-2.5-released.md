title: SuperDuper! 2.5! Released!
---

A [most welcome update](http://www.shirt-pocket.com/blog/index.php/shadedgrey/comments/superduper_25_released/) that brings [Leopard](http://www.wincent.com/knowledge-base/Leopard) compatibility at last. I make simple `tar`-based backups of my home directory every two hours via a `cron` job, but I've been without whole-disk backups for a while now because [SuperDuper!](http://www.wincent.com/knowledge-base/SuperDuper!) has been out of action. It's good to have it back!
