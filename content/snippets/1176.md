To celebrate the new year, a [hard reset](/wiki/Hard_reset).

Machine didn't wake from sleep on opening shell after a time away (screen was black, screen backlight was not on). Tried a few buttons and closing/re-opening, but in the end had to hold the power button down to hard reset.

I suspect a problem with the power supply. The battery is so weak now that even when at 80 or 90% it occasionally goes to sleep as though the battery were dead. Machine claims battery is at "58% health". Going to have to get it serviced soon, before Apple stops doing battery service on this model, but I don't want to be without the machine for too long.

Despite this incident, the average time between failures for this machine is 94.4 days (up from 87.74), which isn't bad at all.
