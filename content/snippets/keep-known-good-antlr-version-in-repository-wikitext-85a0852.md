title: Keep known-good ANTLR version in repository (wikitext, 85a0852)
tags: snippets

I've had a fair bit of trouble getting things back up and running with the move to ANTLR 3.0.1, so I'm going to store a known-good version of ANTLR (source archive plus patches) in the repository. This may be paranoid but I don't won't to get caught out in the future.
