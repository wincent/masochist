title: Why I don't like installing plug-ins

[An example](http://www.rorsecurity.info/2007/10/28/restful_authentication-login-security/) of why I try to keep the number of installed plug-ins down in a [Rails](http://www.wincent.com/knowledge-base/Rails) application. It's all too easy to see a "neat feature" and think, "Great! It's a one-line install!", but the code is unlikely to be as closely vetted as the core Rails codebase itself.
