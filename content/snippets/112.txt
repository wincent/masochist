title: Arq S3 data format
tags: arq
---
Arq stores backup data in S3 in a format similar to that of the open-source
version control system 'git'.  

When you first run Arq and give it your public and private S3 keys, it creates
an S3 "bucket" with the name "<yourpublickey>.com.haystacksoftware.arq". It
also creates a "universally unique identifier" (UUID) for your computer.


Folder Configuration Files
--------------------------

Each time you add a folder for backup, Arq creates a UUID for it and stores 2
objects in your S3 "bucket":

S3 object: /<computer_uuid>/buckets/<folder_uuid>

    This file contains a "plist"-format XML document that looks like this:

        <plist version="1.0">
            <dict>
                <key>BucketUUID</key>
                <string>408E376B-ECF7-4688-902A-1E7671BC5B9A</string>
                <key>BucketName</key>
                <string>company</string>
                <key>ComputerUUID</key>
                <string>600150F6-70BB-47C6-A538-6F3A2258D524</string>
                <key>LocalPath</key>
                <string>/Users/stefan/src/company</string>
                <key>IsEncrypted</key>
                <true></true>
                <key>Excludes</key>
                <dict>
                    <key>Enabled</key>
                    <false></false>
                    <key>MatchAny</key>
                    <true></true>
                    <key>Conditions</key>
                    <array></array>
                </dict>
            </dict>
        </plist>

    NOTE: The folder's UUID and name are called "BucketUUID" and "BucketName"
    in the plist; this is a holdover from previous iterations of Arq and is not
    to be confused with S3's "bucket" concept.


S3 object: /<computer_uuid>/bucketnames/company/uuids/<folder_uuid>

    This is a cross-reference file so that Arq can find a folder by name.
    It is always 36 bytes long and contains the folder's UUID.


Commits, Trees and Blobs
------------------------

When Arq backs up a folder, it creates 3 types of objects in S3, "commits",
"trees" and "blobs". 

Each backup that you see in Arq corresponds to a "commit" object in the backup
data.  Its name is the SHA1 hash of its contents. The commit contains the SHA1
of a "tree" object in the backup data. This tree corresponds to the folder
you're backing up.  

Each tree contains "nodes"; each node has either the SHA1 of another tree, or
the SHA1 of a file (or multiple SHA1s, see "Tree format" below).


S3 Storage Basics
-----------------
At the most basic level, Arq stores name/blob pairs in S3. The name of each
blob is its SHA1 hash.

Because of this naming, each unique blob is stored only once. If 2 files on
your system have the same contents, only 1 copy of the contents will be stored
in S3. If the contents of a file change, the SHA1 hash is different and the
file is stored as a different blob.

Files are blobs, and commits and trees are blobs as well.

Encryption
----------
Each blob is encrypted using AES-256 with the encryption key you chose when
you first ran Arq.

The SHA1 used for the blob's name is the SHA1 of the *encrypted* blob.

Arq version 1 used your encryption password as the encryption key.
Arq version 2 derives a key from your encryption password using the PKCS5_PBKDF2_HMAC_SHA1() function.
See the CryptoKey.m source code for more details: https://github.com/sreitshamer/arq_restore/blob/master/io/CryptoKey.m


Compression
-----------
Starting with version 2, Arq now compresses all data chunks, extended attributes, and ACLs.
Compression is gzip format.
In the Tree and Node formats below, the fields "xattrs_are_compressed", "acl_is_compressed", and "data_are_compressed"
indicate whether the data referred to by the SHA1 needs to be unzipped (after it's decrypted).


Commit Format
-------------

A commit contains the following bytes (see "Data Format Documentation" below
for explanation of [String], [UInt32] and [Date]):

    43 6f 6d 6d 69 74 56 30 30 36      "CommitV006"
    [String:"<author>"]
    [String:"<comment>"]
    [UInt64:num_parent_commits] 
    (
        [String:"<parent_commit_sha1>"]
        [Bool:is_commit_encryption_key_stretched] /* only present for Commit version 4 or later */
    )   /* repeat num_parent_commits times */

    [Int64:create_time_nsec]
    [Int64:st_blocks]
    [UInt32:st_blksize]

Notes:

- A Node can have multiple data SHA1s if the file is very large. Arq breaks up
  large files into multiple blobs using a rolling checksum algorithm. This way
  Arq only backs up the parts of a file that have changed.
- "<thumbnail sha1>" is currently unused.
- "<preview sha1>" is currently unused.
- "<xattrs sha1>" is the SHA1 of a blob containing the sorted extended
  attributes of the file (see "XAttrSet Format" below). Note this means
  extended-attribute sets are "de-duplicated".
- "<acl sha1>" is the SHA1 of the blob containing the result of acl_to_text()
  on the file's ACL. Note this means the ACLs are "de-duplicated".
- "create_time_sec" and "create_time_nsec" contain the value of the
  ATTR_CMN_CRTIME attribute of the file


XAttrSet Format
---------------

Each XAttrSet blob contains the following bytes:

    58 41 74 74 72 53 65 74  56 30 30 32    "XAttrSetV002"
    [UInt64:xattr_count]
    (
        [String:"<xattr name>"]
        [Data:xattr_data]
    )


More on S3 Storage
------------------

In general, each blob is stored as an S3 object with a path of the form:

    /<computer_uuid>/objects/<sha1>

But for small files, the overhead associated with putting and getting the
objects to/from S3 makes backing them up very inefficient.

So, small files (files under 64KB in length) are stored in "packs", which are
explained below.


Packs
-----

Each folder configured for backup maintains 2 "packsets", one for trees and
commits, and one for all other small files. The packsets are named:

    <folder_uuid>-trees
    <folder_uuid>-blobs

Small files are separated into 2 packsets because the trees and commits are
cached locally (so that Arq gives reasonable performance for browsing backups);
all other small blobs don't need to be cached.

A packset is a set of "packs". When Arq is backing up a folder, it combines
small files into a single larger packfile; when the packfile reaches 10MB, it
is stored on S3. Also, when Arq finishes backing up a folder it stores its
unsaved packfiles no matter their sizes.

When storing a pack, Arq stores the packfile as:

    /<computer_uuid>/packsets/<folder_uuid>-(blobs|trees)/<sha1>.pack

It also stores an index of the SHA1s contained in the pack as:

    /<computer_uuid>/packsets/<folder_uuid>-(blobs|trees)/<sha1>.index
