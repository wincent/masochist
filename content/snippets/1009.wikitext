Comcast is evil. After my 1 year of "introductory price" cable internet access, I've now gone through my 2nd year of "not quite as discounted" access and am now in the "ridiculously overpriced" $80/month zone (this is for basic cable; not at all interested in the expensive and unnecessary "everything including the kitchen sink" bundles). This feels like a bait and switch; a terrible way to reward loyalty, and an abuse of near monopoly. No wonder they are one of the most hated companies in the nation.
