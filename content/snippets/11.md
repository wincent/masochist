Just pushed out an update. The real motivation for this update was that I wanted to deploy [Wikitext](/wiki/Wikitext) version 2.1.1 which contains a bug fix that I need (it really should have been a commit of its own but in an oversight it got squashed into commit 5883320, "Add stubs for Git::Blob and Git::Tree implementations"):

    70297a8 Update to Wikitext 2.1
    1239689 Update to jQuery 1.4.3
    a395dde Update to Haml 3.0.22
    121f6e0 Update to Capybara 0.4.0
    5883320 Add stubs for Git::Blob and Git::Tree implementations
    88e0e73 Add Git::Hunk spec file
    8d0417d Set up autoloads for Git::Blob and Git::Tree
