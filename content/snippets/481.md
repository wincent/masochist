Just deployed a new version of the site. For the record, total memory usage for all [Unicorn](/wiki/Unicorn) processes is 234,340 KB. Will watch that over the coming days. My impression from casual observation over the last 3 weeks was that memory bloat simply didn't happen at all despite no restarts, and certainly never went over 250 meg.
