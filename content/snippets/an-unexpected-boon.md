The first official non-X version of OpenOffice.org for [Mac OS X](http://www.wincent.com/knowledge-base/Mac%20OS%20X) is out. I was so surprised I checked the calendar to make sure it wasn't April 1st... Still a long way to go, but this is a very important step. More details [here](http://rss.slashdot.org/~r/Slashdot/slashdot/~3/122333015/article.pl).
