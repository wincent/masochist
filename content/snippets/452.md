Trying to choose a network monitoring service; the number of choices is bewildering. [Nagios](/wiki/Nagios) is probably the most popular [open source](/wiki/open_source) solution, but it seems massively overengineered and complex for my simple needs (of monitoring a handful of services on two hosts). [Zabbix](/wiki/Zabbix) looks decent but also looks like overkill. I am thinking of writing a really simple script, using [RRDTool](/wiki/RRDTool) for storage (nice example of how to do that [here](http://martybugs.net/linux/rrdtool/traffic.cgi)). Could put a simple [Sinatra](/wiki/Sinatra)-based front-end on it.
