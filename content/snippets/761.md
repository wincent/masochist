So I sold my 27" iMac and am now using a 13" MacBook Air. Amazing little machine, definitely "the most portable portable" I've ever had. Between this and an iPhone, owning an iPad as well would seem superfluous. I would never want to use this kind of thing as a full-time stand-alone development environment, but when plugged into an external monitor, keyboard and Magic Trackpad, it becomes practical.
