Looks like it's not [Capistrano's fault](/twitter/110). [SSH](/wiki/SSH) will try any keys you have in `~/.ssh` automatically before it even prompts [Capistrano](/wiki/Capistrano) for a password. So to fix the issue I've dumped passwords and have switched to public key authentication; probably should have done that all along (why didn't I?).
