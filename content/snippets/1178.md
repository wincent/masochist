Sigh, not off to a great start with this machine. [Hard reset](/wiki/Hard_reset) because I go stuck at the lock screen and couldn't log back into the account I had just stepped out of (the root account, because â€” again, sigh â€” I had to [enable that](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204012) because [you can't change the icon on your `~/Documents` folder as a mere administrator](https://discussions.apple.com/thread/253648025) ðŸ¤¦) nor could I switch back to my normal account (which still had a running session in the background). Note that the only reason I'd tried to go back to the lock screen from the root session was because the Finder was [beachballing](/wiki/Beachballing) and the Control Center was too (so I couldn't access Fast User Switching from there). I have no idea how to switch to another account from the lock screen on Sonoma â€” it seems only to magically let me see the "other" user prompt intermittently, according to some magical criteria that I don't understand.
