Brain wave: I find [Git](/wiki/Git) submodules really useful, and I always wonder why people complain so much about them. Just realized that the reason I find them so painless if probably because I'm either developing on the same branch all the time, or when I do switch branches its for a short-lived topic branch in which the submodule doesn't even get touched.
