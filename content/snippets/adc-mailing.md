Just got the latest Apple Developer Connection mailing (September 2006) and am a little disappointed to see that there's no Leopard preview disc in it. Seems like Apple still only wants those who attended WWDC to have it. I unfortunately couldn't go (no cash, no visa). Ironic that it is far easier for pirates to obtain the software than it is for ADC Select members (cost US$500 per year).
