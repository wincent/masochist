Touch wood: when I first got this machine it looked like it was going to be a bit of a lemon (ie. [3 kernel panics and 5 hard resets in the first 120 days](/wiki/Involuntary_Reboot_Log_2.8), giving an average time between failures of 15 days). Haven't had any failures though, since 15 July, which makes 114 days without a failure. Yay.
