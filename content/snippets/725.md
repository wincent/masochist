[UX Myths](http://uxmyths.com/) (User Experience Myths) is a great little site that sets out to debunk myths about web application design. Most of it seems pretty sensible except for "Myth" \#18, [Flash is evil](http://uxmyths.com/post/717781129/myth-18-flash-is-evil). That's a not a myth at all. Flash *is* evil. It punched me in the arm and rode off on my bike.
