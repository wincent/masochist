title: Bump version number post-release (wikitext, fd80e1c)

The released version was 0.1. As far as I can tell this is basically a feature-complete release (in terms of the features that I have envisioned for 1.0), so any subsequent releases will be bug-fix-only ones, probably following a numbering scheme like 0.2, 0.3 and so on.

The plan is to use the bundle in production, add more specs, correct any issues that might come up, and go to 1.0 once a reasonable interval has passed.
