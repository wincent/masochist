[What went wrong with GitHub earlier today](https://github.com/blog/744-today-s-outage): "Before every run of our test suite we destroy then re-create the database so that we have a known, clean starting point. This also allows us to continuously integrate topic branches with potentially different database schemas. Due to the configuration error GitHub's production database was destroyed then re-created." As words fail me, I'll just stick with [O\_o](http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=O_O).
