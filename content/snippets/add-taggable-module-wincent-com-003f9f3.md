title: Add Taggable module (wincent.com, 003f9f3)
---

Add a very simple Taggable module designed for use with model classes. The public interface consists of "tag" and "untag" methods (for adding and removing tags) and a "tag\_names" method (for getting an array of tag names that apply to a model instance).
