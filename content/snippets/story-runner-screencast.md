Pat Maddox has published a [35 minute screencast](http://evang.eli.st/blog/2007/10/8/story-runner-top-to-bottom-screencast) showing [RSpec](http://www.wincent.com/knowledge-base/RSpec)'s new Story Runner in action (see also Pat's [previous post](http://evang.eli.st/blog/2007/9/1/user-stories-with-rspec-s-story-runner) on the story runner).

The Story Runner is an exciting development as it will finally bring built-in acceptance testing to RSpec, but it's not yet released and the API is likely to fluctuate a bit (lots of discussion on the mailing list about it) so I'm holding off for now.
