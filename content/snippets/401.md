[Rails 3 beta out](http://weblog.rubyonrails.org/2010/2/5/rails-3-0-beta-release) ([another take](http://www.engineyard.com/blog/2010/rails-3-beta-is-out-a-retrospective/), and also the [release notes](http://guides.rails.info/3_0_release_notes.html)). Seeing as I already have a very complicated server migration that has to be completed before 20 February I won't be testing it myself yet though; will instead probably wait until [release candidate](/wiki/release_candidate) stage.
