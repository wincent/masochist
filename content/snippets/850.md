git.kernel.org is the speed demon: cloning git.git itself from there comes down at 3.5MB/sec; the same from GitHub comes down at 2.13MB/sec. For comparison, the internal Gerrit server at the office pushes out data at 12.4MB/sec (even with SSH overhead), and git.wincent.com goes at about 2.15MB/sec.
