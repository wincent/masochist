Ok, found out what my linking problem was, and why I am running it to it for the first time when targeting 64-bit architecture (previously I had always just targeted 32-bit): `GCC_SYMBOLS_PRIVATE_EXTERN` actually hides Objective-C classes when building for 64-bit, unlike it does for 32-bit (Google informs that [I am not the only one who was surprised by this](http://lists.apple.com/archives/xcode-users/2009/Dec/msg00178.html)). Solution? `mv GCC_SYMBOLS_PRIVATE_EXTERN /dev/null` (figuratively speaking).
