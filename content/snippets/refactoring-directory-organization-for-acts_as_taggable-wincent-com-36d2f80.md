title: Refactoring (directory organization) for acts_as_taggable (wincent.com, 36d2f80)
tags: snippets

Switched over a number of model classes to use acts\_as\_taggable and re-organized some of the subfolders to make the inclusion a little neater (requiring "active\_record/acts/taggable" rather than "taggable").
