title: Involuntary Reboot Log 3.8 and 3.9
tags: involuntary.reboot.log snippets
---

Third and fourth failures on [Lion](/wiki/Lion). One a system lockup (mouse pointer froze, media playback stalled, machine became unusable), and another a spontaneous reboot during the reboot after the [hard reset](/wiki/hard_reset). Ouch. Lion is proving to be much less stable than either [Leopard](/wiki/Leopard) or [Snow Leopard](/wiki/Snow_Leopard) ever were.
