title: Dispose of old "install" subfolder (Synergy, 6b5a178)
tags: snippets

Most of the files previously in the "install" subfolder are no longer needed and so can be removed. The remaining important files (those to be included with the Synergy distribution) are moved to a new top-level subfolder, "distribution".
