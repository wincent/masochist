Many years ago, before Core Animation, Core Image, or Core Anything, I had a number of techniques for doing cross-fades between window content. Surprisingly, the most effective one used a total kludge: superimposing another window on top of the other one and manipulating its alpha. Today, revisiting that old code to see if I could do things a little more elegantly using more modern technologies, I am sad to report that I've yet to find anything that beats the old technique. Sad but true? I wish it weren't so.
