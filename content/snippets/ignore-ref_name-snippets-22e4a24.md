title: Ignore ref_name (snippets, 22e4a24)
---

Ignore ref\_name for now seeing as it is not used for any real purpose. If I\
later decide to take specific actions depending on the reference name (for\
example, distinguishing between unannotated tags, annotated tags, branch\
commits and tracking branch events, as demonstrated in the post-receive-email\
hook that comes with Git) I can always do something with the ref\_name.
