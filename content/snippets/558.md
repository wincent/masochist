I often find that after a long editing session in [Vim](/wiki/Vim) I have a huge number of open buffers (100 or more) and my [MiniBufExplorer](http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=159) ends up taking up half my screen. A quick "reset" can be achieved with `:bufdo silent! bdelete` which will blow away all buffers, except for those with unsaved changes in them.
