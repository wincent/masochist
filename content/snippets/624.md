[Steak](/wiki/Steak) 1.0.0.beta.1 is [nearing release](http://github.com/cavalle/steak/commit/5ac538db8673b09fe58a03d86eeec7cd9fcea190). I'm glad about that, as it is one of only two remaining `:git` source dependencies in my [Rails](/wiki/Rails) app's `Gemfile`, and I'd like to go with 100% released gems only.
