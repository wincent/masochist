[mongrel2](http://mongrel2.org/index) is apparently a new project by Zed Shaw. Looking at the description of it, can't yet decide whether it's a reinvention of the wheel, a "solution" to a non-existent problem, or simply vaporware. Wouldn't recommend experimenting with it anyway, given Zed's history. Sticking with [Unicorn](/wiki/Unicorn).
