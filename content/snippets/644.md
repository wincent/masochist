I said [only yesterday](/twitter/473) how I was soon to deploy repo-browsing functionality, "just a simple history viewer which permits you to see a list of repos, and see commits (and diffs) on the master branch"; after only a few hours' more work it already allows you to view branches and tags too, and I've spruced up the commit logs with some JavaScript goodness for good measure. It's amazing how fast you can add this kind of functionality (two whole new controllers, a bunch of views, and some JS) in Rails. I'll probably get tree and blob-browsing in place before deploying too. But first, time to get pagination implemented.
