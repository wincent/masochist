title: Story Runner update
---

David Chelimsky has put a lot of work into the new [RSpec story runner](http://blog.davidchelimsky.net/articles/2007/10/21/story-runner-in-plain-english), incorporating suggestions from a wide range of people and arriving at a solution that seems pretty much acceptable to everyone.

Looking forward to using it, although until the [API](http://www.wincent.com/knowledge-base/API) is final I'm not going to touch it; too many other things on the go right now to spend time chasing a moving API.
