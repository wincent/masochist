---

Was fully charged, closed laptop, opened it, screen black and machine unresponsive to key presses, or opening and closing. Tried hard reseting/power cycling. Tried Command-S and Command-V to at boot to go into single user or verbose mode. Screen stays black although backlight comes on. Tried plugged into power: same result. Ultimately PRAM reset worked (Option-Command-P-R).
