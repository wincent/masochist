Just tried running [Walrus](/wiki/Walrus) under [JRuby](/wiki/JRuby), for kicks, to see how performance is with batch-processing a large number of templates using `walrus fill`; unsurprisingly, it rips through them very quickly and memory usage is relatively low despite the memoization employed by the [packrat parser](/wiki/packrat_parser). [MRI](/wiki/MRI), on the other hand, suffers from crippling memory bloat under this kind of workload; you either exhaust all memory on the system (because it doesn't get Garbage Collected even though it should) and your machines slows to a halt and the run never ends, or you CTRL-C the process.
