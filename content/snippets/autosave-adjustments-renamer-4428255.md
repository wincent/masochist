title: Autosave adjustments (REnamer, 4428255)

Turn off column order and size autosaving for the preview table; it doesn't work properly because our preview table view sometimes has two columns and sometimes three, and the one whose presence is toggled is the first one.

At the same time, turn on autosaving for the preview pane itself.
