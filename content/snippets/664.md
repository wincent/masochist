Bored to death of reading about the polemic Zed Shaw. I want to keep abreast of interesting technical developments, not things like [this latest storm in a tea cup](http://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/e1uuv/please_take_this_down_and_write_your_own_book_zed/). Unfortunately, given the size of Zed's ego and his insatiable thirst for attention, the chance of him ever doing a "\_why"-style disappearing act are infinitesimal.
