Didn't go for the [wireless keyboard](http://www.apple.com/keyboard/). For me, the lack of numeric keypad, the lack of USB ports, and the inherent flakiness of wireless connections make this a pretty unattractive option for me. Instead, I opted for the [traditional USB keyboard](http://store.apple.com/us/product/MB110LL/A). It will be the second such keyboard that I've owned. Best Apple has ever made in my opinion. Quiet, comfortable, easy to keep clean, and utterly reliable.
