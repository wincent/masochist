A couple of tiny enhancements to my web-based [Git](/wiki/Git) repository browser at <http://git.wincent.com/>: each project's summary page now shows the `git clone` [URL](/wiki/URL) so that people won't make the mistake of trying to clone over [HTTP](/wiki/HTTP); and the "owner" field is now a full-name-plus-email pair rather than just an email address.
