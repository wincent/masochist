title: More repository migrations

Continued yesterday's work of migrating a number of key Subversion repositories onto other servers. This is in part because I want to install Leopard on a separate drive on the local machine and be able to check out the Leopard branches of various projects onto that machine; given that I don't really want to share filesystems between the pre-release OS and my production install (and in any case I'm even less interested in running Subversion on a pre-release system) this means that I've had to move a number off repositories off of the local host.
