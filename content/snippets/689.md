[This post](http://collectiveidea.com/blog/archives/2010/11/29/ssl-with-rails/) suggests that you enforce an "SSL-all-the-time" approach at the application level, using a gem. Personally, I think that's the wrong level. I think a much more appropriate boundary is at the front end; for example, at the nginx level, use rewrite rules and redirects to ensure that non-SSL traffic never even touches your Rails app.
