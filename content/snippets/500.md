At the start of this month I got my first full-month bill since moving to [AWS](/wiki/AWS). It was a saving of 68% off what I used to pay at [INetU](/wiki/INetU). And today I was finally able to pick up a couple of "reserved instances", which means that from here on (for the next 3 years) my costs will drop to about half their current levels (ie. 80% off what I used to pay at INetU; and that's including the fee required to actually reserve the instances).
