[CentOS](http://www.centos.org/) is a repackaging of [Red Hat Enterprise Linux](/wiki/Red_Hat_Enterprise_Linux), basically just built using Red Hat's source *sans* Red Hat logos and trademarks. The sad thing is that while [Wikipedia describes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CentOS) CentOS as "a community-supported, mainly free software operating system based on Red Hat Enterprise Linux", the CentOS website itself describes itself as "an Enterprise-class Linux Distribution derived from sources freely provided to the public by a prominent North American Enterprise Linux vendor." It seems crazy that you can't even refer to the *name* of the vendor whose work you're using — completely legally — as a basis for your derived work, for fear of litigation. Note here that I am talking about stating the origin of the derivation, not tacitly implying endorsement from the upstream vendor.
