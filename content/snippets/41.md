Second failure on [Lion](/wiki/Lion), this time a [hard reset](/wiki/hard_reset) due to wonkiness. Definitely not the only weirdness I've seen on Lion, but this is the first time it's been severe enough to force a hard reset.

Specifically, on mounting a disk image, most apps died and respawned. Menu bar disappeared and wouldn't reappear. Keyboard stopped working although mouse clicks still worked. Entered fullscreen and then couldn't get out of it. Closed machine, reopened it, tried to switch users at password prompt, but machine effectively frozen.
