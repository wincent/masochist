Sort your spam folder by "Subject". It makes it easier to visually scan the folder rapidly to make sure there are no false positives; often many spam messages will have matching subjects and so will stand out when grouped together, and if you don't speak asian languages then you'll benefit from seeing most of the asian-character-based messages bubble up to the top.
