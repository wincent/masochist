[Kernel panic](/wiki/Kernel_panic) while trying to reboot. This is the first recorded failure I've had for this machine (there may have been non-recorded failures though[^specifically]). Battery drained fast, something putting machine under load, load average then shot up to astronomical levels:

[^specifically]: Specifically, this is not the first time I've had to reboot this machine because it was apparently stuck in a permanently high load state. Maybe on those other times too there could have been a problematic reboot.

```
$ uptime
 13:55:37  up 1 day  3:15,  5 users,  load average: 343.29, 177.94, 77.20
```

The panic happened while I was trying to restart the machine. Brief excerpt:

```
