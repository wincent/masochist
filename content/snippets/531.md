I didn't know that Twitter had switched to [Unicorn](/wiki/Unicorn) but apparently [it has](http://engineering.twitter.com/2010/03/unicorn-power.html). Unicorn is a great project and it's great to see it pick up such a high-profile user. (I was impressed enough with Unicorn to dump my long-running [Mongrel](/wiki/Mongrel)-based set-up when I moved to the [cloud](/wiki/cloud) back in February.)
