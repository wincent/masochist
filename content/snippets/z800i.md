I really want [one of these](http://www.sonyericsson.com/spg.jsp?cc=es&lc=es&ver=4000&template=pp1_loader&php=php1_10235&zone=pp&lm=pp1&pid=10235)... the fast, slick UI seems to cure most of my gripes with Sony Ericsson's demented T610 and Z600 designs (two phones I've had the misfortune of owning). The only problem is the phone costs almost 500€.
