It's been a couple of years since [I last looked](/blog/kool-aid-drinking-rails-fanbois-flocking-to-phusion-passenger-in-inebriated-droves) at the NetCraft server survey.

Nice to see that in [the latest installment of the survey](http://news.netcraft.com/archives/2011/02/15/february-2011-web-server-survey.html), [nginx](/wiki/nginx) has risen [from](http://news.netcraft.com/archives/2009/02/18/february_2009_web_server_survey.html) 1.60% to 7.57% market share (in absolute numbers this corresponds to an increase of about 17 million servers).

Also nice to see is how Microsoft's market share has dropped from about 29% down to around 20%, the lion's share of which seems to have gone to Apache, whose market share rose from 48.59% to 60.10%. Microsoft's loss represents not only a drop in market share, but also a drop in absolute numbers from around 63 million servers down to 57 million.

Good to see superior [open source](/wiki/open_source) products trumping meritless proprietary cruft.
