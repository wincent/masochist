Just "pseudo-released" [askpass](/wiki/askpass) (ie. I've published the source code, but haven't yet packaged a formal downloadable release). You can use this as a `sudo` password prompter via the `SUDO_ASKPASS` environment variable in environments where there is no tty available (for example, from inside [MacVim](/wiki/MacVim)).
