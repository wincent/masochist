Have done a lot of crypto work this week: code signing, code encryption, tools for quickly generating keys and salts. Good stuff. Wish I could say more but I like a nice layer of [security through obscurity](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_through_obscurity) (STO) over my cryptographically strong foundation. STO sucks when it's your only source of security; when it's just one layer of many it's not actually such a bad thing.
